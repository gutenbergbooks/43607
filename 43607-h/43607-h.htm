and hopeful than that of the scattered

<h2><a name="ALFIERI_THE_POET" id="ALFIERI_THE_POET">ALFIERI, THE POET</a></h2>


<p class="start-chap"><span class="smcap">Alfieri</span> was more than a great poet, he was
the discoverer of a new national life in the
scattered states of Italy. Putting aside consideration
of his tragedies as literature, no student
of the eighteenth century can fail to appreciate
his influence over Italian thought. It was as
though a people who had forgotten their nationality
suddenly heard anew the stories of
their common folk-lore. The race of Dante, of
Petrarch, and of Tasso spoke again in the words
of Alfieri.</p>

<p>It was high time that disunited Italy should
find a poet&rsquo;s voice. There was no vigor, no resolution,
no originality from Turin to Naples, people
of all classes were sunk in apathy. No wonder
that foreign lovers of medi√¶val Italy turned
their eyes away from the seats of so much former
glory; there seemed little hope in a people given
over to trivial personal enjoyment. There was no
liberty of speech or action&mdash;sentiment, reason, passion
were all measured by the grand-ducal yard-stick.</p>

<p>At about the middle of this artificial eighteenth
century, in 1749, Vittorio Alfieri was born at Asti,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in Piedmont. His parents were of the upper rank
in the close social order of the small kingdom,
his father Antonio Alfieri, a man of independent
means, who, as one biographer has it, &ldquo;had never
soiled his mind with ambition or his hands with
labor.&rdquo; His mother was the widow of the Marquis
of Cacherano, and had two daughters and a
son before she married Antonio Alfieri. After
the latter&rsquo;s death, which occurred when Vittorio
was scarcely a year old, she married again, and it
was this stepfather, the Chevalier Giacinto Alfieri
di Magliano, who stood in place of father to Vittorio
and his sister, as well as to their older
half-brother and sisters. Although these other
children were near his own age the boy Vittorio
seems to have passed a lonely childhood, driven
into unusual solitude by the waywardness of his
nature.</p>

<p>While still a child, Alfieri was sent away to
the Academy of Turin, the first of those journeys
in which he was later to take such delight. He
cared little for books or study of any sort, he
was over-critical, and yet without the ambition
to perfect himself. He spent his time, as he says,
in his famous memoirs, in acquiring a profound
ignorance of whatever he was meant to learn; and
he left the Academy not only with no knowledge
of what were termed the humanities, but with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
interest in any language, speaking a mixed jargon
of French and Piedmontese, and reading
practically nothing. Knowledge was held in small
esteem by all classes at that particular time, and
the priests, who formed the teaching class, were at
small pains to spread a zeal for learning which
they did not share. Alfieri says, &ldquo;We translated
the Lives of Cornelius Nepos; but none of us, perhaps
not even the masters, knew who these men
were whose lives we translated, nor where was their
country, nor in what times they lived, nor under
what government, nor what any government was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of the extraordinary incapacity of his
teachers, Alfieri did succeed in learning something,
although he was always at great pains to decry
his early education. He learned sufficient Latin
to translate the Georgics of Virgil into his Italian
dialect, and he was fond of reading Goldoni and
Metastasio. A little later he passed into a more
advanced grade, where he met many foreign
youths who had been sent to Turin to study, and
where he was allowed some liberty in choosing his
own course. He found as much fault with these
new conditions as with the old. &ldquo;The reading of
many French romances,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the constant
association with foreigners, and the want of all occasion
to speak Italian, or to hear it spoken, drove
from my head that small amount of wretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Tuscan which I had contrived to put there in
those two or three years of burlesque study of
the humanities and asinine rhetoric.&rdquo; In place
of it he learned and read much French, then the
language of polite society.</p>

<p>In such aimless desultory fashion Alfieri passed
his boyhood. He hated all restraint, and was
continually getting into difficulties with the officers
of the Academy. He had more money than
was good for him, and spent it in the wildest
extravagances whenever the opportunity offered.
He bade fair to become a more or less typical
member of the Piedmont nobility, perhaps a little
more of a free-thinker than most, and considerably
more restive. He chafed at the lack of freedom
allowed him at the Academy, and on the marriage
of his sister to the Count Giacinto Cumiana besought
her and the Count to use their influence
to have his scholar&rsquo;s bonds loosened. They succeeded,
and Alfieri promptly took advantage of
his liberty to join in all the dissipations of the
capital, and to gratify his passion for riding.
In about a year he became the owner of a stable
of eight horses. When his older friends cautioned
the boy against his extravagance he answered that
he was his own master and intended to do as he
chose.</p>

<p>While still at the Academy the youth had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sought a position in the army, but very short
service as ensign in a militia regiment proved to
him that he was as little fond of military restraint
as of scholastic. He traveled to Genoa with two
boy friends and fell in love with their sister-in-law,
a vivacious brunette. He worshiped her
from a distance, becoming, as he writes in his
ardent Italian, &ldquo;a victim to all the feelings which
Petrarch has so inimitably depicted ... feelings
which few can comprehend, and which fewer
still ever experienced.&rdquo; On his return from Genoa
he considered himself a great traveler, and spoke
as such, only to be laughed at by the English,
French, and German boys who had been his classmates.
Immediately he was seized with a passion
for travel. He was only seventeen years old,
and knew that he would not be permitted to travel
alone. Fortunately an English teacher was about
to set out with two scholars on a journey through
Italy, and was willing to have Alfieri join his
party. So strict was the court of that day that
the King&rsquo;s consent had to be obtained before the
youth could leave the country. Through his
brother-in-law&rsquo;s influence Alfieri obtained the royal
permission to go abroad.</p>

<p>The travels had been looked forward to with
the greatest excitement. When they were begun
Alfieri professed himself utterly bored by almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
everything he saw. As one of his biographers
says, &ldquo;He was driven from place to place by a
demon of unrest, and was mainly concerned, after
reaching a city, in getting away from it as soon
as he could. He gives anecdotes enough in proof
of this, and he forgets nothing that can enhance
the surprise of his future literary greatness.&rdquo;
Whether this desire to surprise his readers is really
the keynote of the first years in his memoirs or
not, it would appear that the youth was about
as restless and turbulent-minded a creature as
could be met with. The further he traveled in
Italy the less he liked it; he would not speak the
language or read the literature, he looked at an
autograph manuscript of Petrarch with supreme
indifference, and wished to be mistaken for a
Frenchman. Yet this boy was to become, in time,
the real reviver of Italian letters.</p>

<p>After a fortnight in Milan the party traveled
to Florence by way of Parma, Modena, and
Bologna. Neither people, buildings, views, pictures,
nor sculpture interested Vittorio; he no
sooner reached a city than he was eager to be posting
on. Even Florence, later to be his home, did
not attract him; the only object he found to admire
in the city was Michael Angelo&rsquo;s tomb at
Santa Croce. He must have been the worst traveling
companion possible; he hurried his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
from Florence to Rome, and finding nothing there
to interest him except St. Peter&rsquo;s, went on to
Naples. Naples was in the midst of a carnival,
and Alfieri plunged into its extravagances as
though to distract his thoughts from some brooding
melancholy. He was presented to the King,
went to all the balls and operas, rode, gamed,
made one of the fastest set, and yet in the midst
of it all was discontented. He wanted to be alone,
and finally applied to the King of Piedmont
through his minister at Naples for permission to
travel by himself. His request was granted, and
at nineteen he set out to make what was then the
fashionable grand tour. He traveled in state,
with plenty of money, and a body servant, and with
letters of introduction to the various courts.</p>

<p>It so happened that Alfieri had met certain
French actors during a summer holiday, and
from talking with them he felt a desire to see
something of the French stage. He had no wish
to try his own skill at dramatic compositions&mdash;indeed
his only thought of an occupation at this
time was that he should some day enter the diplomatic
service&mdash;but he was anxious to see something
different from the absurdly conventional Italian
plays produced by the school which took its name
from Metastasio. He went first to Marseilles,
where he spent his time between the theater and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
solitary musing on the seashore. Thence, after a
short stay, he journeyed to Paris, full of the keenest
anticipations of finding pleasure in that famous
city. His memoirs tell us his feelings there. He
writes: &ldquo;The mean and wretched buildings, the
contemptible ostentation displayed in a few houses
dignified with the pompous appellation of hotels
and palaces, the filthiness of the Gothic churches,
the truly vandal-like construction of the public
theaters at that time, besides innumerable other
disagreeable objects, of which not the least disgusting
to me was the painted countenances of
many very ugly women, far outweighed in my
mind the beauty and elegance of the public walks
and gardens, the infinite variety of the carriages,
the lofty fa√ßade of the Louvre, as well as the number
of spectacles and entertainments of every
kind.&rdquo; Verily the young Alfieri was either the
hardest of all travelers to suit, or the older man,
looking back, wished to emphasize the perverseness
of his youth.</p>

<p>The Piedmontese Minister presented the young
traveler to Louis XV., concerning whom Alfieri
wrote, &ldquo;He received with a cold and supercilious
air those who were presented to him, surveying
them from head to foot. It seemed as if on presenting
a dwarf to a giant he should view him
smiling, or perhaps say, &lsquo;Ah! the little animal!&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
or if he remained silent his air and manner would
express the same derision.&rdquo; He was not at all attracted
by the French court, which he considered
very pompous, and was anxious to be out on the
highroads again, driving his post-horses. In
January, 1768, he crossed the channel and landed
at Dover.</p>

<p>England delighted him, he found London far
more to his taste than Paris, he was charmed
with the country, the large estates, the inns, the
roads, the horses, the people, all pleased him. He
was particularly struck with the absence of poverty.
For a time he even thought of settling there
permanently, and years afterwards when he had
seen much of all the European countries he said
that Italy and England were the two he infinitely
preferred as residences.</p>

<p>But of the pleasures of London&rsquo;s fashionable
life the young wanderer soon tired, and for variety
turned coachman, and drove a friend with whom
he was staying through all the city streets, leaving
him wherever he wished, and waiting patiently
on the box for his return. &ldquo;My amusements
through the course of the winter,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;consisted
in being on horseback during five or six
hours every morning, and in being seated on the
coach-box for two or three hours every evening,
whatever might be the state of the weather.&rdquo; His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
tastes at this time were closely akin to those of
many of his English friends.</p>

<p>Finally he left London and went to Holland.
There he met Don Joseph d&rsquo;Acunha, the Portuguese
Ambassador, a man of considerable literary
taste, who induced him to read Machiavelli, and
first led him to think of trying his literary skill.
At The Hague he also fell deeply in love, and, quite
according to the fashionable custom of the time,
with a young married woman. For the moment
his fits of morbidness and continual unrest left
him, he contrived constantly to be with the woman
he loved, and even followed her and her husband
to Spa. A short time afterwards the husband
started for Switzerland, and the young wife returned
to The Hague. For ten days Alfieri was
constantly in her society, then came a message
from her husband bidding her follow him. She
wrote Alfieri a note saying farewell and sent it
to him through D&rsquo;Acunha after she had left the
city. The youth was prostrated and with the
violence of his nature planned to kill himself. He
complained of illness and had himself bled. When
he was alone he tore off the bandages with the
idea of bleeding to death. His faithful valet,
however, knew the peculiar nature of his master,
and entered Alfieri&rsquo;s room. The bandages were
replaced, and the incident ended, although it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
long before the young man could recover from
the parting with his fair lady. He passed
through Belgium to Switzerland, and so on back
to Piedmont, still wrapped in recollections, and
unable to awaken any lasting interest.</p>

<p>Living with his sister, first in the country, and
later in Turin, a short term of peace succeeded in
Alfieri&rsquo;s life. He set himself to reading, and
studied with considerable care the popular French
authors, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire.
Plutarch, however, became his chief companion.
In one of the most characteristic pages of his
memoirs we find him writing, &ldquo;The book of all
others which gave me most delight and beguiled
many of the tedious hours of winter, was Plutarch.
I perused five or six times the lives of Timoleon,
C√¶sar, Brutus, Pelopidas, and some others. I
wept, raved, and fell into such a transport of fury,
that if any one had been in the adjoining chamber
they must have pronounced me out of my
senses. Every time I came to any of the great
actions of those celebrated individuals, my agitation
was so extreme that I could not remain seated.
I was like one beside himself, and shed tears of
mingled grief and rage at having been born in
Piedmont and at a period and under a government
where it was impossible to conceive or execute
any great design.&rdquo; Plutarch first set before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
him vividly the contrast between the Italy of the
past and of his own day. As a result he became
dissatisfied with his own inability to win any high
distinction.</p>

<p>The winter of his twentieth year found Alfieri
still without any definite plans, now studying
astronomy, now considering a diplomatic career.
With spring he determined again to travel, and
in May set off for Vienna. The spirit of unrest
had given place to a brooding melancholy. In
this sense of the times being out of joint and himself
without work to do was born the gradual
desire to write something different from and in a
more heroic strain than the rigorously conservative
dramas of the day. He traveled with Montaigne&rsquo;s
Essays in his pockets, and Montaigne,
he says, first taught him to think. He still
found difficulty in reading Italian and much
preferred foreign authors to those of his own
land.</p>

<p>In Vienna Alfieri had a chance to meet the most
eminent of then living Italian authors, a man much
admired in his generation. The opportunity he
declined. &ldquo;I had seen Metastasio,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in the
gardens of Sch√∂nbrunn, perform the customary
genuflection to Maria Theresa in such a servile
and adulatory manner, that I, who had my head
stuffed with Plutarch, and who embellished every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
theory, could not think of binding myself, either
by the ties of familiarity or friendship, with a
poet who had sold himself to a despotism which I
so cordially detested.&rdquo; In Berlin he was presented
to Frederick the Great, and as he writes &ldquo;mentally
thanked Heaven I was not born his slave.
Towards the middle of November I departed from
this Prussian encampment, which I regarded with
detestation and horror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Berlin the young man went to Denmark,
thence to Sweden, thence to Russia. He says,
&ldquo;I approached Petersburg with a mind wound
up to an extraordinary pitch of anxiety and expectation.
But alas! no sooner had I reached
this Asiatic assemblage of wooden huts, than
Rome, Genoa, Venice, and Florence rose to my
recollections, and I could not refrain from laughing.
What I afterwards saw of this country
tended still more strongly to confirm my first impression
that it merited not to be seen. Everything
but their beards and their horses disgusted
me so much, that during the six weeks I remained
among these savages I wished not to become acquainted
with any one, nor even to see the two or
three youths with whom I had associated at Turin,
and who were descended from the first families
of the country. I took no measure to be presented
to the celebrated Autocratrix Catherine II., nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
did I even behold the countenance of a sovereign
who in our days has out-stripped fame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later he was back in England, and now
again he fell in love, this time also with a married
woman of rank. With a truly Byronic audacity
he defied all the conventions, accompanied
the woman everywhere, and became a subject of
town scandal. Finally confronted by the husband,
he fought a duel with swords in a field near St.
James&rsquo;s Park, his left arm being in a sling at the
time as the result of a bit of too daring horsemanship.
Alfieri was slightly wounded, and the
husband declared himself satisfied. Shortly after
the latter sued for divorce, bringing the Italian&rsquo;s
name into the case. The newspapers took up the
scandal, and the matter became a cause cel√®bre.
Alfieri was on the point of proposing marriage,
when the woman, by her own confessions, told him
that such a result was impossible. With his ardor
completely cooled and his mind given to the bitterest
thoughts he left London, and after short
stays in The Hague and Paris journeyed into
Spain.</p>

<p>In Paris he had bought the best known Italian
authors and at this time commenced to read them,
although it was not until much later that he began
to appreciate them at their real worth. He
did, however, carry them with him on his travels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and gradually learned something at first hand
of that great galaxy, Dante, Tasso, Petrarch,
Ariosto, Boccaccio, and Machiavelli. His mind
was not yet ripe for any study, even as he traveled
in Spain he was still subject to those wild outbreaks
of despondency and passion which alternately
seemed to seize upon him. He became a creature
of chance whims, now he was ready to yield to the
quiet contentment of a suitable marriage, now
burning with rage against all the customs of society.
Morbid ideas continually pressed his footsteps.
The atmosphere of a malevolent passion
seems almost always surrounding the great tragedies
he later penned, and that atmosphere was generated
by a nature which from earliest youth had
been extraordinarily violent. His temper was
wholly ungovernable. One evening in Madrid, as
Alfieri&rsquo;s faithful valet, the companion of all his
travels, was curling his hair, he accidentally pulled
it so sharply with the tongs that Alfieri winced.
Instantly he sprang from his chair, and seizing a
heavy candlestick, hurled it at the servant. It
struck the man on the temple, and instantly his
face was covered with blood. He rushed at his
master, but fortunately a young Spaniard who
was present came to the rescue, and separated
them. Immediately Alfieri was covered with
shame. &ldquo;Had you killed me,&rdquo; he said to the man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
&ldquo;you would have acted rightly. If you wish,
kill me while I sleep to-night, for I deserve it.&rdquo;
The valet took no such reprisal, he had been with
his young master long enough to understand the
sudden outbursts of his temper, and was content
to keep the two blood-stained handkerchiefs that
had bandaged his head and show them occasionally
to Alfieri as a reminder.</p>

<p>In Lisbon the traveler formed a close friendship
with the Abbot of Caluso, whom he called a
&ldquo;true, living Montaigne.&rdquo; The Abbot tried to
interest the young man in literature, induced him
to write some verses, and gave him the benefit of
his criticism. For a short time the interest in
poetry lasted, then it flagged, and again Alfieri
felt himself without any purpose. He decided to
return home, and in May, 1772, arrived at Turin.</p>

<p>Now he took a house for himself, furnished it
elaborately, and made it the headquarters of a
youthful society that sought amusement in various
forms. Some of them wrote, and Alfieri tried his
pen for their amusement, but soon tired of writing
as a sport, and gave himself up to other
occupations. Continually searching for something
to still his restlessness he again fell in love,
this time with a woman of rank, some ten years
his senior, and of a most unenviable reputation.
He became absolutely her slave, worked himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
into frenzies on her account, would consider nothing
but the happiness of being with her. He fell
very ill, but when he recovered found himself as
much in love as ever. For two years he lived in
this state of obsession, tormented by self-reproach,
but unable to rid himself of his own yoke.</p>

<p>Finally he decided to quit Turin and break his
fetters. When he was only a short distance on the
road to Rome his resolution failed and he returned.
Again he resolved to leave the city for a year.
The year lasted eight days. He was thoroughly
ashamed, disliked being seen in Turin, but could
not keep away. He felt finally that he must take
one last stand or lose all self-respect and control
forever. He had his hair cut so short that he
dared not appear in society, and shut himself into
his house to read. He could not keep his thoughts
on the books, and tried composition. He wrote
a sonnet, and sent it to a friend, and received a
reply highly praising it. Then he remembered
that a year before as he sat watching by the sick
bed of the woman who had so charmed him he had
lightly outlined a tragedy on the life of Cleopatra,
taking his subject from tapestries that hung in
the room. He threw himself into the work of
writing that tragedy now, and found that interest
in it drove all other thoughts away. He wrote
rapidly, continually, only stopping when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
completely tired. When those times came, still
frightened with the possibility of leaving the
house, he had himself tied into a chair. He only
allowed himself freedom when he knew he had won
self-control. By that time he had finished his
tragedy in blank verse called &ldquo;Cleopatra,&rdquo; and
a short farce called &ldquo;The Poets,&rdquo; the latter ridiculing
the former. He sent them to a theater in
Turin, where they were produced on June 16,
1775, and met with success. The author did not
value either play highly himself, and sought to
have them withdrawn. He wrote later, comparing
these works with those of his contemporaries,
&ldquo;The sole difference which existed between their
pieces and mine was that the former were productions
of learned incapacity, whereas mine was the
premature offspring of ignorance, which promised
one day to become something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His battle against what he considered a highly
unworthy infatuation had restored Alfieri&rsquo;s self-respect
and health, and out of this curious struggle
sprang his first real and lasting ambition. &ldquo;A
devouring fire took possession of my soul,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;I thirsted one day to become a deserving candidate
for theatrical fame.&rdquo; The date of that
first performance marked a turning point, not only
for Alfieri, but for his country&rsquo;s literature. It was,
said the Italian critic, Paravia, &ldquo;a day and a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of eternal memory not only for the Turinese, but
for all Italians; because it was, so to speak, the
dawn of the magnificent day which, thanks to
Alfieri, was to rise upon Italian tragedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The restless energy which had driven Alfieri
across the various European countries now concentrated
in an all-pervading determination to become
a tragic poet. He launched into that effort
with the same unbounded ardor with which he had
so frequently before launched into love. He was
twenty-seven years of age when he seriously set
himself to work to acquire command of Italian so
that he might think in the language of his native
land rather than in that of France. He described
his resources as &ldquo;a resolute, obstinate, and ungovernable
character, susceptible of the warmest affections,
among which, by an odd kind of a combination,
predominated the most ardent love, and
hatred approaching to madness against every species
of tyranny; an imperfect and vague recollection
of several French tragedies which I had seen
represented several years before, but which I had
then neither read nor studied; a total ignorance of
dramatic rules, and an incapability of expressing
myself with elegance and precision in my own
language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To accomplish his purpose Alfieri now began at
the very beginning and took up the study of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Italian grammar, and thence made a first-hand
acquaintance with all the best of the early Italian
writers. He would not allow himself any longer
to read French, and tried to break himself of the
habit of thinking in that tongue. He moved from
town into a small country village in order that
nothing might distract him. There he re-wrote for
the third time his tragedy of &ldquo;Cleopatra,&rdquo; and
practised turning into Italian verses the outlines
of two tragedies which he had recently written
in French. He pored over Tasso, Ariosto,
Petrarch, and Dante until he felt that he at last
really caught the full spirit of each author&rsquo;s
style, then he tried writing poetry of his own.</p>

<p>His ignorance of Latin continually vexed him,
and now he employed a teacher to begin over those
lessons he had so thoroughly disliked at school.
It was very hard work at first, but he would learn
what he now considered essential to his purpose,
and after three months&rsquo; study of Horace he found
that he could read Latin. He took up the other
classics and translated some of them into modern
Italian for practice in their varied styles.</p>

<p>Turin was too near France to satisfy his new
passion for only the purest Italian and so he went
to Pisa, and thence to Florence. In the latter
city he found that his ideas were at last shaping
themselves in the rich and clear Italian he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
seeking, he wrote verses which critical friends pronounced
at last worthy of the name of poetry,
and planned several poetic tragedies. He had
worked hard and felt that he needed a little rest.
For this purpose he returned to Turin and had
the pleasure of entertaining his old friend the Abbot
of Caluso there. He, as well as other friends,
urged Alfieri to make literature his field. He decided
that it was best for him to live in Tuscany,
and as he hated to have to ask royal permission
each year to allow him to remain away from Piedmont&mdash;as
was the custom with the nobility&mdash;he
gave his estates at Asti to his sister, and contented
himself with half his former income. Then he
moved to Florence, which, except for intervals
spent at Rome and Naples, was for a considerable
time to be his home.</p>

<p>On his way to Florence Alfieri was obliged to
stop at Sarzana, where he chanced upon a copy
of Livy, and was so impressed with the story of
Virginia and Icilius that he immediately planned
a tragedy on the subject. Soon after he reached
Pisa, but there he did not dare stay, fearful that
he might be involved in a marriage with a young
girl whom he had met there before and with whom
he says that he had almost fallen in love. He
himself contrasts his feelings at that time with
those he had entertained when he had first thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of marriage. &ldquo;Eight years afterwards, my
travels through Europe, the love of glory, a passion
for study, the necessity for preserving my
freedom, in order to speak and write the truth
without restraint&mdash;all these reasons powerfully
warned me that under a despotic government it is
sufficiently difficult even to live single, and that no
one who reflects deeply will either become a husband
or a father; thus I crossed the Arno and
arrived at Siena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Siena he met a company of strongly intellectual
people, and from one of these, a friend who
became a close confidant, he gained the idea of
writing a tragedy founded upon the conspiracy
of the Pazzi. Here he also wrote the first two
books of an essay upon Tyranny, which was
printed several years later. Thoroughly absorbed
in his literary work Alfieri moved to Florence at
the beginning of the winter, and took up his residence
there.</p>

<p>At that time there were living in Florence, under
the titles of Count and Countess of Albany,
Charles Edward, &ldquo;the Young Pretender&rdquo; to the
English throne, and his wife. The latter, who had
been Louisa, Princess of Stolbergh, had been
married when nineteen to the Stuart prince, who
was considerably her elder. Charles Edward had
an unsavory reputation and knew more drunk than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sober moments. As a result the young Countess,
who was very beautiful and extremely fond of
the fine arts and of society, was the object of
much romantic pity. When Alfieri came to Florence
he found the entire city at the feet of the
Countess. Every one condemned the Count&rsquo;s quarrelsome,
tyrannical, libertine nature, every one
praised the Countess&rsquo;s sweet and sunny disposition.
Friends offered to introduce Alfieri to the
star of Florence, but he declined on the ground
that he always shunned women who were the most
beautiful and most admired. He could not avoid,
however, seeing her in the park and at the theater,
and the first sight of her was destined never
to be effaced. Thus he writes of her: &ldquo;The first
impression she made on me was infinitely agreeable.
Large black eyes full of fire and gentleness,
joined to a fair complexion and flaxen hair, gave
to her beauty a brilliancy difficult to withstand.
Twenty-five years of age, possessing a taste for
letters and the fine arts, an amiable character, an
immense fortune, and placed in domestic circumstances
of a very painful nature, how was it possible
to escape where so many reasons existed for
loving?&rdquo;</p>

<p>De Stendhal gives an account of their first meeting,
which if inaccurate (it does not appear in Alfieri&rsquo;s
memoirs) is at least characteristic of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
man. According to this story Alfieri was presented
to the Countess in one of the galleries of
Florence, and noticed at the time that the lady
was much interested in a portrait on the walls of
Charles XII. She told the poet that she admired
the costume exceedingly. Two days later Alfieri
appeared in Florence dressed exactly like the portrait
of the Swedish King, and so presented himself
before the Countess. The act was quite in keeping
with the poet&rsquo;s nature.</p>

<p>Alfieri made a determined effort to fight against
the passion he had cause to fear, and made a hurried
journey to Rome. He could not stay there,
and returned to Florence, stopping at Siena to see
his friend Gandellini, to whom he spoke of the
Countess, and who did not counsel him against
giving way to the fascination.</p>

<p>On his return to Florence he acknowledged that
he was deeply in love. This love, however, he felt
ennobled him, and instead of causing him to give
up his work, continually inspired him to new literary
heights. He wrote, &ldquo;I soon perceived that the
object of my present attachment, far from impeding
my progress in the pursuit of useful knowledge,
or deranging my studies, like the frivolous
woman with whom I was formerly enamoured,
urged me on by her example to everything dignified
and praiseworthy. Having once learned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
know and appreciate so rare and valuable a friend,
I yielded myself up entirely to her influence.&rdquo;
From the commencement of this new affection, the
best and most lasting of his life, date the finest
works of his genius.</p>

<p>There had been long delays in settling Alfieri&rsquo;s
estate in Piedmont, and arranging that he might
live in Tuscany, but the presence of the Countess
urged him imperatively to remain in Florence.
When the business arrangements were finally at
an end he found it would be necessary for him
to curtail his former expensive style of living.
This he did, giving up his horses, all his servants,
except a valet and cook, and most of his personal
luxuries. Books were the only expense he indulged
in, he acquired gradually a very large and choice
library. He took a small house, and devoted himself
to his dramas, seeing as much as he could in
leisure moments of the beautiful Countess. During
these three quiet years he wrote his tragedies
&ldquo;Virginia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Agemennone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don Garzia,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Maria Stuarda,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oreste,&rdquo; a poem on the
death of Duke Alexander, killed by Lorenzino de&rsquo;
Medici, had rewritten his drama of &ldquo;Filippo,&rdquo;
and partly prepared the tragedies &ldquo;Timoleone,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ottavia,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rosmunda.&rdquo; All of these works
are built on the classic Grecian model, and flame
with hatred of tyranny, and burn with civic vir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>tue.
In that they show their kinship to the author&rsquo;s
times. De Sanctis, always a brilliant critic,
says: &ldquo;The situations that Alfieri has chosen in his
tragedies have a visible relation to the social state,
to the fears, and to the hopes of his own time. It
is always resistance to oppression, of man against
man, of people against tyrant.... In the classicism
of Alfieri there is no positive side. It is an
ideal Rome and Greece, outside of time and space,
floating in the vague ... which his contemporaries
filled up with their own life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At about the end of the dramatist&rsquo;s third year
of residence in Florence, the ill-treatment of the
Countess of Albany by her husband caused her
friends, and chief among them Alfieri, to plan for
her release from such servitude. To this end they
secured her entrance first into a convent at Florence,
and then, with the consent of the Grand
Duke of Tuscany and the Count&rsquo;s own brother the
Cardinal of York, her removal to Rome. So
afraid were her friends lest the Count should
effect a rescue that they surrounded her carriage
with a body of horsemen as she left Florence, and
Alfieri rode on the coach box until she was well on
her road.</p>

<p>While the Countess had been in Florence, Alfieri
had worked assiduously there; now that she was
gone he found composition impossible, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a very short interval went to Naples, planning to
wait there until he should learn what the Countess
would do. It was not long before it became
apparent that the courts of Europe had taken up
the wife&rsquo;s cause against her husband. The Pope
gave her a pension and approved of her taking
apartments in the house of her brother-in-law.
The court of France gave her the pension which
the Count had previously indignantly declined as
being insufficient for his position. Alfieri learned
at last that the Countess was living in entire independence
of her husband, and after a further
stay of a month in Naples in order to avoid possible
scandal he moved to Rome, and took up his
residence there.</p>

<p>With this new settled existence he began to write
again, and produced at this time &ldquo;Saul,&rdquo; his fourteenth
tragedy, and one of his finest works. He
took infinite pains with all his dramas, planned
them again and again, wrote version after version,
and then selected the forms he preferred after careful
judgment, polished them line by line and word
by word until he was satisfied. He wished to try
the effect of his characters upon an audience, and
had himself acted, together with some of his friends,
his play of &ldquo;Antigone.&rdquo; He found he had not
mistaken his ability as a dramatist. At about
the same time he published part of his works,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sending four dramas to the printer. Their publication
excited immediate and flattering attention.
His life in Rome was the most delightful
he had yet known. His house was a pleasant
villa near the Baths of Diocletian. Here he wrote
and studied in the morning. Later in the day he
went for long rides through the neighboring country,
and the evenings he spent with the woman who
had become his chief inspiration.</p>

<p>In time, however, the poet&rsquo;s visits to the Countess
became the subject of unfavorable comment,
and the Cardinal, her brother-in-law, brought the
matter to the attention of the Papal Court. Realizing
the delicacy of the situation, Alfieri reluctantly
decided that he must quit Rome, and in
May, 1783, he set out again as a wanderer, his
ambition lost, his life offering him no further
interests.</p>

<p>As in early youth he now took to rapid traveling
for solace, carrying on at the same time a
continual correspondence with the Countess. He
wrote a few sonnets, but found that his mind was
too unsettled to allow him to engage in any more
lengthy labors. He went to France, and then to
England, and in each country visited scenes which
the impetuosity of his youth had neglected.
Horses again made their appeal to him in London,
and he bought fourteen, &ldquo;as many horses as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had written tragedies,&rdquo; he states. With these
horses he soon returned to Turin, and made a short
visit to his mother, whom he had not seen for a long
time. When he left her he went to Piacenza, and
here he heard that the Countess had at last been
released from the restraint under which she had
lived at Rome, and that as her health was delicate
she had gone to Baden. He was in two minds as
to his course, the thought of possible calumny to
her bade him refrain from going to Baden at once,
and he tried to content himself in Siena with his
old friend Gandellini. The continual interchange
of letters gradually wore away his resolution, and
at last the time came when he could keep from her
no longer. August 4, 1784, he set out to join her
and within a fortnight felt his old joy return.
Immediately his thoughts grew fertile, he began
to write again as he had not done since he had
quitted her in Rome. There was no question but
that her presence acted as a continual inspiration
to his genius.</p>

<p>To this period of new happiness belonged the
dramas of &ldquo;Agide,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sofonisba,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mirra.&rdquo;
The plot of the latter came to him as he was reading
the speech of Mirra to her nurse in the &ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo;
of Ovid, and was written in the first
heat of his emotion at the woman&rsquo;s words. He was
somewhat in doubt as to the success of a play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
written on such a subject, but it was hailed as a
triumph at its first presentation some years later,
and made a remarkable impression on Byron and
on Madame de Sta√´l, and was considered by most
critics as Ristori&rsquo;s finest impersonation.</p>

<p>After two months the Countess had to return to
Italy, and Alfieri&rsquo;s gloom at the separation was
further increased by the news of the death of his
friend Gandellini. He went to Siena, but found
that city lonely without his friend, and passed the
winter in Pisa. He did a great amount of reading,
repolished his later dramas, and prepared new
volumes of them for the press. When winter ended
he spent another two months of summer with the
Countess at Colmar, and then again they separated.
This time he resolved to work unremittingly,
and did so until his health failed and he had to
rest. At about the same time the Countess decided
to leave Italy permanently, and at length
Alfieri, towards the close of 1786, joined her and
went with her to Paris. He writes in his memoirs
of this journey into France, &ldquo;This country which
had always proved extremely disagreeable to me,
as much on account of my own character, as the
manners of the people, now appeared a perfect
elysium.&rdquo; There are many glimpses to be had of
this new life in the French capital. Montanari
recounts how the Marquis Pindemonte, himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
dramatist, used each evening to take an omelette
souffl√© in the Countess&rsquo;s room, while Alfieri sat in
the chimney corner sipping his chocolate. Under
such peaceful auspices the poet spent many months
in a critical preparation of all his works for new
publication.</p>

<p>In February, 1788, word reached the Countess
that her husband had died in Rome, and it would
appear that she was soon afterwards married to
Alfieri, although in the will of the latter she is referred
to as the Countess of Albany and not as
his wife. His memoirs do not once speak of her
as his wife, but from the date of her husband&rsquo;s
death their life together was uninterrupted. It
is now generally assumed that they were privately
married about this time.</p>

<p>For three years the two lived quietly in Paris,
spending their summers and autumns at a new
home Alfieri had acquired in Alsace. During these
years he printed two editions of his works, supervised
their sales, and wrote his remarkably entertaining
memoirs, which were finished up to May,
1790. The end of the three years found Paris on
the brink of the great Revolution.</p>

<p>Alfieri saw the black clouds gathering on the
French horizon, but stayed on in the desire to complete
the printing of his works. He was in turn
amazed, alarmed, and disgusted at the succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
events in the establishment of a republic. The
principles proclaimed by these so-called destroyers
of tyrants were not the principles of his own freedom-loving
heart, nor those of any of his heroic
characters. He writes, &ldquo;My heart was torn asunder
on beholding the holy and sublime cause of
liberty betrayed by self-called philosophers,&mdash;so
much did I revolt at witnessing their ignorance,
their folly, and their crimes; at beholding the
military power, and the insolence and licentiousness
of the civilians stupidly made the basis of
what they termed political liberty, that I henceforth
desired nothing more ardently than to leave
a country which, like a lunatic hospital, contained
only fools or incurables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Circumstances, however, conspired to keep them
in Paris, the Countess was dependent upon France
for two-thirds of her income, Alfieri was finishing
the printing of his dramas. The hour came when
Alfieri determined that further delay would be more
than foolhardy, and so, on August 18, 1792, having
obtained passports with great difficulty, he
drove with the Countess to the city barrier. A
dramatic scene followed. The National Guards
found the passports correct, and would have let the
travelers pass, but at the same moment a crowd of
drunken revelers broke from a neighboring cabaret,
and attracted by the well-laden carriage, pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>ceeded
to stop its passage, while they debated
whether they should stone it or set it on fire. The
Guards remonstrated, but the revelers complained
bitterly that people of wealth should leave the city.
Alfieri lost all prudence, and jumping from his
carriage, seized the passports from the man who
held them and, as he himself tells the incident,
&ldquo;Full of disgust and rage, and not knowing at
the moment, or in my passion despising the immense
peril that attended us, I thrice shook my
passport in my hand and shouted at the top of my
voice, &lsquo;Look! Listen! Alfieri is my name; Italian
and not French; tall, lean, pale, red hair; I am he;
look at me; I have my passport, and I have had it
legitimately from those who could give it; we wish
to pass, and by Heaven, we <i>will</i> pass!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd was surprised, and before they had
recovered Alfieri and the Countess had driven past
the barriers and were safely on their way. They
had left Paris none too soon. Two days later the
same authorities that had granted the passports
confiscated the horses, furniture, and books that
Alfieri had left behind in Paris and declared both
the Countess and Alfieri refugee aristocrats. The
fact that they were both foreigners appeared to be
of no importance. It was well that they had gone.
The Countess was too illustrious a personage to
have escaped for long the fury of the fast-gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>ing
mob, and had she been lost Alfieri would have
shared her fate.</p>

<p>Florence thenceforth became the home of the
Countess and of Alfieri. He wrote desultorily,
commenting upon what he had seen in France, but
for the most part devoted himself to a study of
the classics. In 1795, when he was forty-six years
of age, he started to learn Greek, and was so fired
with the desire that in a short time he had added an
intimate knowledge of Homer, √Üschylus, Sophocles,
and Euripides to that he already had of the
Latin authors. He was so much interested in the
&ldquo;Alcestis&rdquo; of Euripides that he wrote an original
drama based on the same theme. He was
described at this time as of a tall and commanding
figure, with a face of intelligence, and the look of
one born to command, rather than obey. His
forehead was broad and lofty; his red hair fell
in thick masses around it.</p>

<p>The restless youth had changed to a methodical,
studious man, he arranged his day by rule, and
followed that rule exactly. Only one event disturbed
him, and that was the occupation of Florence
by French troops. He had distrusted the
French while he lived among them, now when they
came to hold Florence in subjection his hatred of
tyranny bade him despise them. He refused to receive
the call of the French general who, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
read his works, was anxious to meet him. On the
correspondence which passed between them in reference
to this matter Alfieri wrote, &ldquo;Dialogue between
a lion in a cage, and his crocodile guardian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had fled from France he had been compelled
to leave some of his printed works behind
him, and he was now in fear lest their appearance
and eager appeal for liberty should seem to ally
him with the Revolutionary cause. Above all
things he condemned the French Revolution. To
avoid this possibility he now advertised in the Italian
papers a disclaimer, warning the public
against any edition of his writings except such as
he himself issued. With this formal announcement
he had to be content.</p>

<p>Alfieri had determined to write no more tragedies,
and turned to composition of comedies, of
which he had six nearly completed when his health
failed. He rested for a time and then resumed
his methodical life of study and work. He was
advised to give himself more recreation, but was
too obstinate to adopt any plan but his own. His
health gave way again, and neglecting the physician&rsquo;s
advice, he tried to minister to his own illness.
Gradually he grew weaker, and on October 3,
1803, he died. He was buried in the Florentine
church of Santa Croce, and his monument, carved
by Canova, rises between the tombs of Michael<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Angelo and Machiavelli. An inscription states
by whom the memorial was erected. &ldquo;Louisa,
Princess of Stolbergh, Countess of Albany, to Vittorio
Alfieri of Asti, 1810.&rdquo; In 1824 she was
buried in Santa Croce.</p>

<p>In his will Alfieri left everything to the Countess.
Their love had grown deeper with time. She
wrote to a friend, &ldquo;You know, by experience, what
it is to lose a person with whom we have lived for
twenty-six years, who has never given us a moment
of displeasure, whom we have always adored, respected,
and venerated.&rdquo; Each, tormented alone,
had found happiness finally in their united life.</p>

<p>What was Alfieri&rsquo;s part in the growth of that
spirit which was preparing to set Italy free? Why
did Mazzini later point him out as one of the great
sources of inspiration for his &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo;?
We must remember that literature and the drama
are more closely related to Italian public opinion
than they are with us, that the appearance of a
new book or play is often a vital subject to a ministry.
What the people read they felt, and it was
Alfieri who first showed them the immorality of
national servitude. One of his best critics has said
that when Alfieri first turned his glance toward the
Italian stage, it presented anything but a hopeful
aspect. &ldquo;The degradation of a people enslaved
under a foreign yoke, and without political life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
could not fail to make itself felt in the theater as
in the more extended arena of public affairs. No
high effort of mind could be born amid such circumstances.
A stage without authors soon ceases
to have actors. When actors and authors both
are wanting an audience will not easily be found.
Thus it was, thus it had been in Italy through
many troubled years. The opera,&mdash;the seductive,
but enervating opera,&mdash;carried to great perfection
by Metastasio, was almost alone in possession
of the popular taste.... Alfieri&rsquo;s first thought
was to improve the taste of his countrymen, by
blending the amusement they were accustomed to
with something better.... Instead of attempting
reform by easy stages, he determined to attempt
everything at once.... It was something
more than an improvement of the stage that he attempted;
it was the improvement of his countrymen;
the regeneration of his country!...
Throughout nearly all his tragedies and his prose
works, the leading idea by which he was animated
stood plainly out. Several pieces he specially calls
tragedies of liberty. They well deserve the name.
He never tired in his denunciations of tyranny, in
his invectives against oppression. These were
themes upon which the more he spoke, the more
eloquent he became.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dramas themselves, built in strict accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>ance
with the three unities of classic taste, may
seem strangely stiff and unemotional to us, but they
carried an immense appeal to the Italian of the
last century. They spoke a new voice and stirred
a new spirit in their hearers. The voice once heard,
the spirit once born, the new idea grew rapidly.
Within a few years after Alfieri&rsquo;s death eighteen
editions of his works had passed through the press.
Two great theaters, one at Milan and one at Bologna,
were built by men eager to present his tragedies.
The influence of his writings was tremendous;
the minds of Italians from Piedmont to
Sicily were stirred to a higher pitch than they had
been for many centuries.</p>

<p>Alfieri&rsquo;s character had many defects, at best his
life was unmoral, but having regard to the society
into which he was born and the early training he
received, more was scarcely to be looked for. He
was passionate, reckless, and untutored in all self-control,
yet he harnessed himself to a work which
possessed his fancy and in its service became the
devotee of study and control. Like his life his
writings lack peace and broad philosophy, but on
the other hand they gain from his peculiar nature
a certain domineering force. Giuseppe Arnaud in
his criticism on the patriotic poets of Italy says,
&ldquo;Whoever should say that Alfieri&rsquo;s tragedies, in
spite of many eminent merits, were constructed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a theory opposed to grand scenic effects and to one
of the two bases of tragedy, namely, compassion,
would certainly not say what was far from the
truth. And yet, with all this, Alfieri will still remain
the dry, harsh blast which swept away the
noxious miasmas with which the Italian air was infected.
He will still remain that poet who aroused
his country from its dishonorable slumber, and inspired
its heart with intolerance of servile conditions
and with regard for its dignity. Up to this
time we had bleated and he roared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let me only add the striking words of his fellow
countryman, the gifted poet-statesman Massimo
d&rsquo;Azeglio. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;one of the
merits of that proud heart was to have found
Italy Metastasian and left it Alfierian; and his
first and greatest merit was, to my thinking, that
he discovered Italy, so to speak, as Columbus discovered
America, and initiated the idea of Italy as
a nation. I place this merit far beyond that of
his verses and his tragedies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alfieri reminded Italians that they had a native
voice.</p>

<h2><a name="MANZONI_THE_MAN_OF_LETTERS" id="MANZONI_THE_MAN_OF_LETTERS">MANZONI, THE MAN OF LETTERS</a></h2>


<p class="start-chap"><span class="smcap">The</span> position of Manzoni in modern Italian life
and literature is doubly interesting, both because
his work in poetry and the drama marks the
vital turning point in the historic battle of Classicism
with Romanticism, and because his romance
&ldquo;I Promessi Sposi&rdquo; is the greatest achievement in
all Italian letters in the field of the novel. Walter
Scott gave the country north of Tweed a history
in the &ldquo;Waverley Novels,&rdquo; and Alessandro Manzoni&rsquo;s
writing a little later, at a time when Scott&rsquo;s
work was a great factor in European literature,
gave Italy a history in the same sense. The inestimable
service that the Waverley Novels did
Scotland &ldquo;I Promessi Sposi&rdquo; did the disrupted
states of Italy.</p>

<p>The spirit of the French Revolution was all-engrossing,
as subversive of the old religions, philosophies,
and literatures, as it was of the old politics.
It represented the actual thoughts of the
men of that era, but it developed so rapidly and
fell into such excesses that its downfall was sudden
and complete. Then the reaction set in, which, as
De Sanctis in his history of the movement says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was &ldquo;as rapid and violent as the revolution....
The white terror succeeded to the red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same critic goes on to show that there were
at this period two great philosophic principles,
materialism and skepticism, and that in opposition
to them there rose a spirituality which was carried
to the heights of idealism. This spirituality approached
the mysticism of medi√¶val days. &ldquo;To
the right of nature,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was opposed the
divine right, to popular sovereignty legitimacy, to
individual rights the State, to liberty authority
and order. The middle ages returned in triumph....
Christianity, hitherto the target of all offense,
became the center of every philosophical
investigation, the banner of all social and religious
progress.... The criterions of art were
changed. There was a pagan art and a Christian
art, where highest expression was sought in the
Gothic, in the glooms, the mysteries, the vague, the
indefinite, in a beyond which was called the ideal,
in an inspiration towards the infinite, incapable
of fruition and therefore melancholy.... To
Voltaire and Rousseau succeeded Chateaubriand,
De Sta√´l, Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Lamennais.
And in 1815 appeared the Sacred Hymns of the
young Manzoni.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This spirit of idealism became the incentive for
the new school of Romance in literature and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
drama, in contrast to the drab materialism of the
Revolutionary age. This school of Romance is
not, however, to be considered as diametrically opposed
to the Classical School, for they had much in
common, and the contrast between them lay not so
much in the spirit which animated them as in the
strict regard of Classicism for the time-hallowed
unities of time, place, and action, and the willingness
of the Romantic School to sacrifice all these
for freedom of movement and effect. The new
school wished to find its poems in the experiences
of men of that day, to write its dramas about any
comedy or tragedy without regard to their classic
form, it wished freedom to grow as its own spirit
might dictate. In Germany and England great
Romanticists were ripening into power, Goethe and
Burger, Scott and Byron were being widely read
in Italy, and the dramas of both Schiller and
Shakespeare were continually translated and reproduced
in Italian verse. The restoration of the
Austrians and Bourbons after the Napoleonic
downfall made any chance to speak political truths
impossible, even in the half-veiled militant form
used earlier by Alfieri. The Romantic School
therefore, confined in its modern scope, turned
backward, became retrospective, and sought its
outlet in the glories of that medi√¶val world which
had been so nearly akin in spirit to the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
sentiment. It turned from recent atheistic tendencies
to a mood of great devotion, from lax
morality to a high degree of upright conduct, from
the regard of liberty as the greatest good to that
of responsibility to mankind as the goal. Only
distantly and secondarily political, this Romantic
movement was first of all moral, and taught Italians
that in order to be good citizens they must be
good men first. As in all literary history the
movement had a deep philosophic meaning, and
this sense of moral responsibility was at the base
of all Manzoni&rsquo;s great creative efforts.</p>

<p>First of all, then, the literary movement which
succeeded the Revolutionary era in Italy was idealistic
as compared with the materialism of the days
of the Napoleonic occupation, and secondly, it was
Romantic in contradistinction to the Classicism of
the earlier times. Greek and Roman themes for
artistic expression were abandoned for the stories
of national medi√¶valism, the Papacy became the
center of its poetic aspiration, and its spirit,
though highly ardent, was far more truly modern
than that of Classicism had been. Our former
critic, De Sanctis, says that in this new movement
religion &ldquo;is no longer a creed, it is an artistic
motive.... It is not enough that there are
saints, they must be beautiful: the Christian idea
returns as art.... Providence comes back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the world, the miracle reappears in story, hope and
prayer revive, the heart softens, it opens itself to
gentle influences.... Manzoni reconstructs
the ideal of the Christian Paradise and reconciles
it with the modern spirit. Mythology goes, the
classic remains; the eighteenth century is denied,
its ideas prevail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manzoni stood first for that new movement
which opposed morality to license in national development,
secondly for the temper which derided
the classic limits of the three unities and held that
a purely national event was as suitable for the
purpose of artistic representation as the stories of
classic history. In addition to this he first
adopted that form of the Romantic spirit which
was rising so rapidly into use in England in the
novels of Walter Scott, in France in the writings of
Victor Hugo and Lamennais, and in Germany in
those of Goethe and Schiller, and gave Italy the
result in his great novel of Italian life and history.
For each of these reasons Manzoni represents a
force potent in upbuilding Italian character and
strengthening it at the time of its great crisis.
Though he drew suggestions from abroad, he made
his work Italian, and thoroughly Italian. &ldquo;If,&rdquo;
says De Sanctis, &ldquo;the Romantic School, by its
name, its ties, its studies, its impressions, was allied
to German traditions and French fashions, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was at bottom Italian in accent, aspiration, form,
and motive.... Every one felt our hopes palpitating
under the medi√¶val robe; the least allusion,
the remotest meanings, were caught by the
public, which was in the closest accord with the
writers. The middle ages were no longer treated
with historical and positive intention; they became
the garments of our ideals, the transparent expression
of our hopes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alessandro Manzoni was born in Milan, March
7, 1785, at about the time when Alfieri was accomplishing
his greatest work. His father, Pietro
Manzoni, belonged to the nobility, and bore the
title of Count, a title which Alessandro, when
he inherited it at an early age, refused to adopt,
and continued to refuse to use during his whole
life. His mother was the daughter of Beccaria,
a man well known throughout Europe for his
studies of political economy and criminology, and
whose treatise entitled &ldquo;Crimes and Punishments&rdquo;
was greatly admired in the Voltairean circles of
France. Alessandro&rsquo;s mother was a remarkably
intelligent woman, with a fineness of nature which
was inherited by her son, and which kept him unspoiled
and simple through a life unusually acclaimed
and applauded.</p>

<p>His earliest youth was spent among the hills of
Galbiate, according to the custom of wealthy Lom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>bard
families, to send their children to the mountains
in order to give them rugged health. The
boy was in care of a woman who was successively
his nurse and governess, and who taught him to
read and stirred his interest in the legends and history
of the neighboring countryside. When still
a small boy he was sent to the church college of the
Frati Lomaschi, education being then entirely in
charge of ecclesiastics. He seems to have been in
no wise an apt student, the close confinement, the
strict discipline, and the dry manner of teaching
subjects which were all of an eminently classical
nature combining to dull his spirits and interest.
Stories are current in Milan of Manzoni&rsquo;s inability
to learn, almost bordering on stupidity, but such
stories are popular of men who have later shown
great ability, and deserve little credence. Suffice
it that he showed no great aptitude for learning at
the school of the Frati Lomaschi, nor even later at
the Collegio dei Nobili. At the latter he did, however,
meet the poet Vincenzo Monti, a man well
known throughout Italy, who had had for patrons
the Cardinals Borghese and Braschi, a poet and
dramatist whose pen was too apt to serve the political
party in power, but who had achieved wide
popularity, and whose poems were praised by
critics as diverse-minded as Byron and Napoleon
Bonaparte. Monti met the young Manzoni when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
he was on a visit to the college, and took an interest
in him. Alessandro admired the poet, and it was
perhaps this acquaintance which first actively interested
him in literature as a pursuit. The meeting
of the boy Walter Scott with Robert Burns is
a parallel in Scottish literary annals.</p>

<p>In 1805, when he was twenty, Alessandro&rsquo;s
father died and the youth left the Collegio dei
Nobili, and returned for a time to his mother.
After a period of home life he was sent to the University
of Pavia, the best-known of Lombard
universities. His stay here was short. His
mother, now a widow for several years, was advised
to go to France for her health, and the close bonds
which united mother and son would not allow of
such a distant separation. Alessandro left the
University and went with his mother to Auteuil,
which was then a fashionable watering place where
the <i>beau monde</i> of French art and letters gathered.
Here and at Paris he met the leading thinkers of
the time, Volney, Cabanis, De Tracy, Fauriel, and
Condorcet, all of whom were interested in the young
man as the grandson of Beccaria and because of
his own originality of thought. These men called
themselves idealogues, and claimed to have shaken
off all the conventions of the previous centuries.
As a student Manzoni had been an extremely liberal
Catholic, and was usually considered by strict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
critics a follower of Voltaire. At Paris and
Auteuil, however, he met so many men of the then
prevalent atheistic mode of thought that his own
interest in his family religion was quickened and
he emerged from his friendship with such men as
Cabanis and Condorcet a more pronounced churchman
than he had been before. It was characteristic
of him to cling tenaciously to those precedents
and standards which had so long survived in his
own country. His religion, however, was soon to
become more to him than a field for philosophic
speculation, for in 1810 he married Louise Henriette
Blondel, daughter of a banker of Geneva,
who, herself a convert from Protestantism to the
Church of Rome, became most ardent in the church
of her adoption. She soon brought Alessandro to
her own enthusiastic view, and from the date of his
marriage his philosophy never varied. Henriette
Manzoni possessed rare beauty, and was long remembered
in Milan &ldquo;for her fresh blond head, and
her blue eyes, her lovely eyes,&rdquo; and the young husband
was ideally happy with his bride. He had
by now determined to try his skill at composition,
and set himself as models the three men whose fame
was then at its height in Italy, Alfieri, Vincenzo
Monti, and Ugo Foscolo.</p>

<p>His bride had brought Manzoni a country seat
as well as considerable property, and so he settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in the country and studied to perfect his style in
writing. His first works were a series of Sacred
Hymns, written directly under the influence of the
renewed religious faith attendant on his marriage.
These were published in 1815, and were at once
noticed as poems alike remarkable for deep religious
feeling and great beauty of expression.
Appearing as they did at a time when religion was
being bitterly assailed, churchmen looked upon the
young poet as a distinct acquisition to their forces.
Manzoni was not, however, even then a believer in
the temporal power of the Pope. He said to
Madame Colet, the author of &ldquo;L&rsquo;Italie des
Italiens,&rdquo; &ldquo;I bow humbly to the Pope, and the
Church has no more respectful son; but why confound
the interests of earth and those of heaven?
The Roman people are right in asking their freedom&mdash;there
are hours for nations, as for governments,
in which they must occupy themselves, not
with what is convenient, but with what is just. Let
us lay hands boldly upon the temporal power, but
let us not touch the doctrine of the Church. The
one is as distinct from the other as the immortal
soul from the frail and mortal body. To believe
that the Church is attacked in taking away its
earthly possessions is a real heresy to every true
Christian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the same view which Manzoni held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
throughout his life, and which, stated in his quoted
words, gives the position taken by the most enlightened
men of the Nationalist party in those later
days when the question of the temporal power of
the Pope became vital for Italy. What the
Sacred Hymns showed was that Manzoni looked to
the Church as the center of all true aspiration and
religion rather than to philosophic theories as the
safeguard of morals.</p>

<p>His next production carried him a step further
in advance of his contemporaries, and marked him
as the leader of the Romantic School. In 1819 he
wrote his first tragedy, published the following
year under the title &ldquo;Il Conte di Carmagnola.&rdquo;
The subject-matter was the career of Carmagnola,
a celebrated condottiere of the Middle Ages, and
the dramatic form was entirely distinct from that
classic construction which had so long tyrannized
over the drama. In an introduction he explains
his departure from the classic unities of time,
place, and action, and gives his reasons for believing
that the dramatist should be free to choose his
own subject and to treat it in such fashion as shall
seem to him best to express his idea. The Elizabethan
dramatists had long before discarded the
law of the unities in England, and had carried
their plots over such courses of time and place as
they pleased, and so had Schiller in Germany, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in Italy the law had been absolute from the time
of Tasso to that of Alfieri. Eight years after
Manzoni&rsquo;s &ldquo;Carmagnola&rdquo; appeared, Victor Hugo
brought on the great dramatic war in France with
his &ldquo;Cromwell,&rdquo; and from the date of his ultimate
triumph in Paris dates the downfall of the Classicists
and the full glory of the Romanticists.</p>

<p>In Italy Manzoni&rsquo;s step was violently attacked
and defended. Conservatives opposed him, but
the younger element immediately acclaimed him as
their leader. The following year, 1821, he wrote
his great ode on the death of Napoleon, which had
occurred on May 5th, at St. Helena, and the news
of which had greatly affected all Europe. The
ode, entitled &ldquo;Il Cinque Maggio,&rdquo; was remarkable
for great dignity, a deep and profound estimate of
Napoleon&rsquo;s genius, and a tribute to his colossal
fame which even the French recognized as the
fittest expression of poetic power. The ode was
at once translated into German by Goethe, and
into English by Gladstone and the Earl of Derby.
It immediately placed him at the head of the new
school of continental poets.</p>

<p>Very soon afterwards, in 1822, Manzoni wrote
his second tragedy, &ldquo;Adelchi,&rdquo; a drama of the war
between the Lombards and Charlemagne. It followed
the lines of the Carmagnola, repeating the
break from classical precedents, and establishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the value of the Romantic School. Both dramas
were acted, but without success. The Carmagnola,
when it was given at Florence in 1828, had the
open support of the court to offset the attacks of
the old school, and yet did not win even a mildly
enthusiastic hearing. The Adelchi was tried
with a similar result at Turin.</p>

<p>In spite of their ill reception on the stage, both
of Manzoni&rsquo;s dramas were immensely popular with
readers, and, although based on incidents remote
in point of time, both thrilled with a patriotism
that stirred the hearts of all Italians. Mr.
Howells says of the tragedies in his &ldquo;Modern Italian
Poets,&rdquo; &ldquo;The time of the Carmagnola is the
fifteenth century; that of the Adelchi the eighth
century; and however strongly marked are the
characters,&mdash;and they are very strongly marked,
and differ widely from most persons of Italian
classic tragedy in this respect,&mdash;one still feels that
they are subordinate to the great contests of elements
and principles for which the tragedy furnishes
a scene. In the Carmagnola the pathos is
chiefly in the feeling embodied by the magnificent
chorus lamenting the slaughter of Italians by
Italians at the battle of Maclodio; in the Adelchi
we are conscious of no emotion so strong as that we
experience when we hear the wail of the Italian
people, to whom the overthrow of their Longobard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
oppressors by the Franks is but the signal of a
new enslavement. This chorus is almost as fine as
the more famous one in the Carmagnola, both
are incomparably finer than anything else in the
tragedies and are much more dramatic than the
dialogue. It is in the emotion of a spectator
belonging to our own time rather than in that
of an actor of those past times that the poet
shows his dramatic strength, and whenever he
speaks abstractly for country and humanity he
moves us in a way that permits no doubt of his
greatness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manzoni&rsquo;s greatest work, however, was yet to
appear, for admirable as were his poems and inspiring
as were his heroic dramas it was as a novelist
that he was to reach his pinnacle of fame. It
was also as a novelist that he was to become one
of the men who directly created that national
spirit which made modern Italy. Italy had had
many poets, but no great novelist since Boccaccio.
Fortunately Manzoni had not been confined to the
literature of his own land, but had studied Goethe,
Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Scott, and drew his inspiration
largely from them. He owed much to
the English novel, and especially to the author of
&ldquo;Waverley,&rdquo; a man whom he much admired, and
who fully returned his admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I Promessi Sposi&rdquo; appeared in 1825 and cre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>ated
a tremendous impression. Scott said that it
was the greatest historical novel ever written, and
Goethe said, &ldquo;It satisfies us like perfectly ripe
fruit.&rdquo; It was the first and greatest Italian romance,
and it awakened an interest throughout
Europe in Italian history. The scene is laid in
Milan under the harsh Spanish rule of the Seventeenth
Century, and the reader is carried through
the story of war and famine, and the great plague.
Its merits are hard to exaggerate, the beauty of its
descriptions and the accuracy of its history, the
intense interest of its characters, a galaxy that
embraces every walk of life, the truth of its philosophy
are equally remarkable. The universal feelings
of humanity pulse through its pages; as Dr.
Garnett says of it, &ldquo;as a picture of human nature
the book is above criticism; it is just the fact,
neither more nor less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Victor Hugo in &ldquo;Les Miserables&rdquo; wrote a book
which appealed to the innate democracy of man,
but Manzoni in &ldquo;I Promessi Sposi&rdquo; made the same
appeal without having recourse to the Frenchman&rsquo;s
use of the grotesque and gigantic. Through
the whole of the latter novel runs the note of a
profound sympathy with the poor and the unfortunate,
a note which is perhaps stronger in this
book than in any romance ever written. It is the
work of a great mind, fully alive to every sensibil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>ity
and sympathy, accurate in its judgments, and
to which, in the ancient words, nothing human is
foreign.</p>

<p>Cardinal and priest, brigand and simple hero,
grande dame and the lovely girl whose hand promised
in marriage gives part title to the book, are
each perfect in their way, and bring the characteristics
of a past century vividly before the
present. Goethe pointed out the too great prominence
of the historical element, but the very careful
attention paid by Manzoni to the accuracy of
his setting must add to the sense of reality which
he so completely gains. The novel was rapidly
translated into all modern languages, and at once
created a school of historical novelists in Italy.</p>

<p>To us who have seen the romantic movement give
place in turn to that of realism, it is difficult to
understand what Scott and Hugo, Goethe and
Manzoni did for the men of the first quarter of the
Nineteenth Century. They made people feel as
they had not felt before the wide scope of existence
and the importance of the individual. Literature
had been a matter of form and convention, of
classic model, of purely aristocratic vision. The
new movement was part of that same impulse which
was demanding constitutions of kings and bringing
the middle classes into political prominence. It
was an awakening of public spirit which had slept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
soundly through several centuries. Voltaire and
Rousseau, Alfieri and Foscolo had sounded the first
notes of a new intellectual renaissance, and now
Hugo and Manzoni went further and stepped
boldly out from all classic restraints.</p>

<p>Although &ldquo;I Promessi Sposi&rdquo; is more widely
known and more highly regarded than any Italian
book, except the Divine Comedy of Dante, Manzoni&rsquo;s
personality impressed itself but little upon
his age. He had not the fighting nature of Victor
Hugo, nor the mental unrest of Byron, two of his
great contemporaries. He preferred the retirement
of his farm to the excitements of Milan, and
although he was always an ardent advocate of
Italian unity and freedom he took but small part
in the great events that soon delivered Lombardy
from Austria. After the appearance of &ldquo;I
Promessi Sposi&rdquo; he wrote little more. &ldquo;Formerly,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;the muse came after me, now I
should have to go after her.&rdquo; His quiet life laid
him open to the charge of an indifferent patriotism,
but those who knew him best understood that
such an accusation was bitterly untrue.</p>

<p>When the Austrian government returned to
Milan the members of the Lombard nobility were
required to write their names in an official register
or forfeit their titles. Manzoni preferred to
lose his claim as a patrician, and later refused a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
decoration, saying that he had made a vow never
to wear any order of knighthood. He afterwards
offered the same excuse to Victor Emmanuel when
the latter wished to decorate him. He was elected
a Senator in 1860, when the first National Assembly
met, and went to Turin to take his seat, but soon
after retired to the privacy of his own home on
Lake Maggiore. Here he entertained many great
guests, among them Cavour and D&rsquo;Azeglio, to
whom he was warmly attached. His life flowed on
an even current, the existence of a philosophic
spirit interested as an observer rather than as an
actor.</p>

<p>Henriette Manzoni died in 1833, and in 1837 he
married Teresa Borri, widow of Count Stampa.
He saw his children grow up about him and go to
take their places in the world. Gradually he saw
the cause of national freedom win its way, and the
King to whom he was so devoted unite the scattered
states under one crown. He saw the fall of the
temporal power of the Pope, and with it the consummation
of his hopes. In 1873, at the age of
eighty-eight, he died, universally mourned and
revered. A Milanese journal said: &ldquo;After the
confessor left the room Manzoni called his friends
and said to them, &lsquo;When I am dead, do what I did
every day; pray for Italy&mdash;pray for the king and
his family&mdash;so good to me!&rsquo; His country was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
last thought of this great man dying, as in his
whole long life it had been his most vivid and constant
affection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was nearly fifty years since his last important
work had appeared, but during that long half
century of inactivity Manzoni&rsquo;s fame had grown
steadily. His romance had passed through one
hundred and eighteen editions in Italian alone.
Milan decreed him a state funeral, and representatives
of all European countries appeared at the old
Lombard capital with addresses from their sovereigns.
It has been said that Manzoni&rsquo;s death
evoked a greater unanimity of sentiment than has
been called forth by that of any other great
author of modern times, except possibly by that
of Sir Walter Scott. Even those who had criticised
Manzoni had always spoken their opinions in
a spirit of reverence. He was regarded as the
great guiding figure in the course of the new national
literature.</p>

<p>A singularly uneventful life for one of the great
builders of a nation, uneventful even for that of
a scholar or poet. Moreover the roll of his works
is small numerically, comprising his Sacred
Hymns, the two dramas, the Ode on Napoleon, the
single novel, and in addition only a few essays, the
&ldquo;Innominata&rdquo; or Column of Infamy, an historical
note to &ldquo;I Promessi Sposi,&rdquo; an essay on the Ro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>mantic
School, called &ldquo;Letters on Romanticism,&rdquo;
and one entitled &ldquo;Letters on the Unity of Time
and Place,&rdquo; the purpose of which was to show that
the unity of action is the only unity of importance
to the dramatist. The bulk of his work was not
great, but each expression of it was masterful in
its way, the Hymns true poetry as well as deep
religious sentiment, the Ode considered the finest
ode in all Italian poetry, the dramas pulsing with
life and feeling, the novel unsurpassed. These
were the literary values of his work, but these in
themselves would not account for Manzoni&rsquo;s influence
on his times. He was a moral and political
force, showing the men of his day that nations can
only hope for liberty and peace when the citizens
respect the law and virtue. A generation that
had lived through the French Revolution and the
Napoleonic era needed some one to lead them back
to moral sanity, and this was the greatest of Manzoni&rsquo;s
works.</p>

<p>Like Gioberti, like D&rsquo;Azeglio, like Victor Emmanuel,
Manzoni was a staunch Catholic as well as
a true Italian. A close friend, Signor Bonghi, said
of him: &ldquo;He had two faiths, one in the future of
Catholicism, another in the future of Italy, and the
one, whatever was said, whatever happened, never
disturbed the other. In anxious moments, when
the harmony between the two was least visible, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
expected it the most, and never allowed his faith in
one or the other to be shaken. Rome he wished
to be the abode of the King; Rome he wished also
to be the abode of the Pope. Obedient to the Divine
Authority of the Pontificate, no one passed a
more correct judgment upon its civil character, or
defended with more firmness, when speaking upon
the subject, the right of the State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That he was the poet of resignation, as Monnier
declared, is disproved by his dramas and his novel.
The martial lyrics of the plays burn with a spirit
only too evidently fired by the contemporary subjection
of Italy to Austria and France. Take for
example the first and last verses of one of the lyrics
in the Adelchi, as rendered into English by Miss
Ellen Clarke:</p>

<p>Could Manzoni have meant such words to speak
other than of the Austrians and Bourbons who
were grinding Italians into servitude? Could his
marvelous meter, which has been said in its &ldquo;plunging&rdquo;
to suggest a charge of horses, have been
meant other than to drive his countrymen to self
assertion? Manzoni was patriot as well as artist,
and read his times with no unskilful eye. When Victor
Emmanuel visited Milan in 1859 he said that
he should like to meet the poet, and, when told that
the latter was ill, declared that he would go to him.
Manzoni, however, would not hear of this, and as
soon as he was able called upon the King. The
sovereign&rsquo;s marks of regard and respect overwhelmed
the poet. Later he said of the meeting,
&ldquo;I see in the character of the King the intervention
of Providence. He is exactly the sovereign that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
circumstances require to accomplish the resurrection
of Italy. He has rectitude, courage, incorruptible
honesty, and disinterestedness; he seeks
not glory or fortune for himself, but for his country.
He is so simple, never caring to appear
great, that he does not meet the admiration of
those who seek to find in princes and heroes theatrical
actions and grandiloquent words. He is natural
because he is true, and this makes his enemies
say that he is wanting in regal majesty. To
found Italian unity he has risked his throne, and
his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manzoni&rsquo;s prophecies came true and he himself
had no small part in accomplishing that great end
towards which so many men of diverse forces
worked. As well as king and statesman, warrior
and prophet, the man of letters taught his people
how to find their independence.</p>

<h2><a name="GIOBERTI_THE_PHILOSOPHER" id="GIOBERTI_THE_PHILOSOPHER">GIOBERTI, THE PHILOSOPHER</a></h2>


<p class="start-chap"><span class="smcap">Gioberti&rsquo;s</span> signal gift to his countrymen
was his great book, &ldquo;II Primato d&rsquo;Italia,&rdquo; a
statement of the causes of Italy&rsquo;s early primacy
among European nations, and a philosophic theory
for her regeneration. Like Savonarola he flayed
the vices of his time and preached redemption
through Christian living, but, unlike the great
Fra, he undertook to teach that the Church was no
less fitted to be the seat of statecraft than of religion.
It was this that gained him the ear of
Rome as well as that of Piedmont, and made it
seem for a moment as though he had found the
solution of Italy&rsquo;s troubles.</p>

<p>The effect of the &ldquo;Primato&rdquo; was felt from Turin
to Naples. &ldquo;The book,&rdquo; said Minghetti, the
statesman of a later decade, &ldquo;seemed to some an
extravagance, to others a revelation. The truth
is, that while many of its ideas were peculiar to the
author, and partook of his character, his studies,
and his profession, the substance of it responded
to a sentiment still undefined, but which had been
slowly developing in the minds of Italians. The
idea of nationality had, in the previous years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
spread far and wide through many channels, open
and secret, and the desire of a great and free country
had taken possession of the majority of the
younger men; but the methods hitherto employed
had proved so inefficient that weariness and disgust
had followed. Experience had proved that
conspiracies, secret societies, and partial insurrections
were of no utility&mdash;that they made the governments
more severe, retarded civil progress, arrested
the increase of public prosperity, plunged
many families into misery, and did not even win
the approbation of civilized nations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rumors of wars and of European insurrections
which were circulated every spring time,
the mystic declamations of Mazzini in the name of
God and the people, ... all these things showed
that the time had come to try another method,
more serious, more practical, and surer....
Gioberti, a Piedmontese exile for the sake of liberty,
had taken part in the earliest phases of
the &ldquo;Giovine Italia&rdquo; or had been in relation with
its chiefs, but had wearied of that pompous and
impotent society. His intellect had anticipated
that change which had been imperceptibly operating
and now began to appear widely ... but
obscurely in the consciousness of many men. This
opportuneness and coincidence of the ideas of the
author with the spirit of the day gave his book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a special importance.... The purpose of the
book was to prove that Italy, although it had
lost all political value for the outside world, contained
all the conditions of moral and political
revival, and that to effect this change there was
no need of revolutions, invasions, or imitations of
the foreigner, since political revival is limited to
three heads&mdash;unity, independence, and liberty&mdash;the
first two of which might be obtained by a confederation
of the various states under the presidency
of the Pope, and the last by means of internal
reforms in each state, effected by their respective
Princes without danger or diminution of
their real power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincenzo Gioberti was born in Turin April 5,
1801, and was the only child of parents of very
moderate means. At an early age it was decided
that he should prepare for the priesthood, and his
education was entrusted to the fathers of the Oratory
in Turin. His nature was more conformable
to the teaching of churchmen than was that of
Alfieri or Manzoni, and whereas both the latter had
chafed under the discipline and mental training
of the Church schools the young Gioberti became
a thoughtful student. He differed from Mazzini,
a contemporary studying at Genoa, in that although
he early learned that the condition of his
country was wretched, his mind could only con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>ceive
of improvement by orderly and temperate
steps. He was a brilliant scholar, and during
the years of his training for the priesthood he
delved deep into the history of philosophy, and
studied closely the writings of the fathers and
doctors of the Roman Church. In 1825 he was
ordained a priest.</p>

<p>The young priest, a man of a serious and reflective
mind, turned his attention to the affairs
of his country, and gradually entered upon a
careful study of the literature of the day, and
the political theories that were then agitating
men&rsquo;s minds. He took part in scholastic discussions
of religious and political subjects, and in time
widened his acquaintance in Turin so that he came
in contact with the leaders of thought in the Sardinian
capital. As he met men and spoke his
thoughts more freely it came to be seen that he
was occupied above everything else with the problem
of freeing Italy from the foreign overlords,
and this gradually marked him as a free-thinking
priest. At first, however, he did not incur the enmity
of the clerical party, for, although his conception
of Italian freedom consisted in emancipation
not alone from the arms of foreign masters,
but from all modes of thought which were alien to
the nation&rsquo;s genius, and detrimental to its national
authority, this authority was always associated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
his mind with the idea of Papal supremacy, but
a supremacy intellectual rather than political.</p>

<p>The reign of Charles Albert of Piedmont was
a continual battle between the conservative party
and the enlightened liberals. The leaders of the
conservatives were clerics, in large measure Jesuits,
who kept in close touch with the Court of Vienna,
realizing to the full that their aims and those
of Austria were to all intents identical, the maintenance
of the <i>status quo</i> in Italy. The young
priest Gioberti was not long in incurring the hostility
of the Jesuits, because, although he sought
the ultimate supremacy of the Papal See, he desired
it as a moral rather than as a physical supremacy,
and he most ardently hoped for the expulsion
of the Austrians from Lombardy and the
absolute independence of Piedmont from Viennese
influence. His was, however, too brilliant a mind
to be denied, and, despite the efforts of the Court
party, Charles Albert, who was always cognizant
of the abilities of other men, soon after his accession
to the throne in 1831 nominated the young
priest to be one of the royal chaplains.</p>

<p>As chaplain of the court Gioberti quickly assumed
prominence. His nature was open and
frank, he made friends easily, he wrote on ecclesiastical
and political subjects, and his patriotism was
known to be unbounded. He soon had gathered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
party about him, and his influence over the King
grew rapidly. Charles Albert&rsquo;s own views on Italian
policy were at that time almost identical with Gioberti&rsquo;s,
he would have been glad to acknowledge
a confederation of Italian states under the presidency
of the Pope, provided the foreign princelings
could be disposed of without bloodshed. This,
however, the clerical party did not approve of, any
change being to their view revolutionary, and the
realization that the chaplain was gaining the private
ear of the King finally compelled them to
mark him for exile.</p>

<p>Aware of this disaffection in the Church party
at Turin, Gioberti in 1833 asked permission of
Charles Albert to resign his chaplaincy, but, before
his request was granted he was suddenly arrested
one day while walking with a friend in the
public gardens of the city, and placed in prison.
The influence of the clerical party was so all-powerful
in the Piedmont of that day that no attempt
to secure Gioberti&rsquo;s release was effective, and no
popular demonstration at such an outrage could
take place. He was given no trial, and his case
was the subject of no apparent judicial process.
After four months&rsquo; imprisonment he was informed
that his banishment had been decreed, and he was
at once conducted to the frontier in charge of a
carabineer. At the same time his name was stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
off the roll of the theological doctors of the College
of Turin.</p>

<p>Driven into exile because of his political opinions,
even as Mazzini was exiled as a suspect rather
than because of any proof against him, Gioberti
reached Paris in October, 1833. Like so many
other great Italians of that day he was destined
to spend many years away from his beloved country.
Without friends, family, or money, his
career apparently ruined, his hopes shattered, Gioberti
was to sound the depths of a courageous
man&rsquo;s despair. Mazzini took himself to London
to eke out a meager living as a teacher of Italian,
and with the same thought Gioberti went to Brussels.
Here he undertook to teach philosophy,
and finally obtained employment in assisting his
friend Gaggia in the management of a small college.
All his leisure time he devoted to studying
and writing on philosophy, rising early, and working
the better part of the night, and producing
work after work of great value in philosophic inquiry,
all of which bore especially upon the needs
of his own countrymen.</p>

<p>His stay in Brussels, which lasted from 1834 to
1845, saw the production of his greatest books,
all deeply earnest, and each one causing in turn
the greatest interest and emotion in Italy. The
volume of his work was most remarkable, treatises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
appearing at short intervals, each one of which
would have sufficed to represent a lifetime&rsquo;s study.
His first work was the result of a friendship
formed in Brussels with a young fellow-exile,
Paolo Pallia, who on one occasion expressed to
Gioberti certain doubts as to the reality of revelations
and a future life. Gioberti at once commenced
work upon his &ldquo;La Teorica del Sovran-naturale,&rdquo;
which was finished and published in
1838. This was followed in 1839 and 1840 by
his three volumes called &ldquo;Introduzione allo Studio
della Filosofia.&rdquo; In all these writings he stands
apart from his contemporary European philosophers.
Method of speculation is with him subjective
and psychological. He adopts much from
Plato. Throughout all his writings religion is
synonomous with civilization, and he repeatedly
states that religion is the true and only expression
of the <i>idea</i> in this life, and is one with the
real civilization of history. Civilization is the
means to perfection, of which religion is the
essence.</p>

<p>These strictly philosophic works were followed
by the essays &ldquo;Del Bello&rdquo; and &ldquo;Del Buono,&rdquo; and
after a short interval by a magnificent exposure
of the Jesuit Order, &ldquo;Il Gesuita Moderno,&rdquo; and his
&ldquo;Del Primato Morale e Civile degli Italiani,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Prolegomeni.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the &ldquo;Primato&rdquo; which gave the exiled
Gioberti his place as a great factor in the struggle
for Italian independence. His ideas seem
strangely archaic now, but they were compelling in
1846. He himself says: &ldquo;I intend to show ...
that Italy alone has the qualities required to become
the chief of nations, and that although to-day
she has almost completely lost that chiefship,
it is in her power to recover it, and I will
state the most important conditions of that renovation....
As infant civilization was born between
two rivers, so renewed and adult civilization
arose between two seas; the former in fertile
Mesopotamia, whence it easily spread over Asia,
Africa and the west; the latter in Italy, which
divides the Tyrrhene and Adriatic seas, thus forming
the central promontory of Europe and placed
in a position to dominate the rest of the hemisphere....
In the Church there is neither Greek nor Barbarian,
and all nations form a cosmopolitan society,
as all the tribes of Israel a single nation. But
as, in the Jewish nation, genealogy determined the
tenure of the hierarchy, and the sons of Levi received
the custody of the Law and the service of
the Temple, so in the Christian commonwealth the
division of the nations is in a manner involved in
the order of the Catholic Church. And, the
Church having a supreme head, we must recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a moral pre-eminence where Heaven has established
its seat, and where nearer, quicker, more
immediate and more uninterrupted are the in-breathings
of its voice. This preeminence certainly
does not transgress the natural order of
divine intentions, real and efficient in their working
and in the obligations they impose. So that
the Italians, humanly speaking, are the Levites
of Christianity, having been chosen by Providence
to keep the Christian Pontificate, and to protect
with love, with veneration, and if necessary by
arms, the ark of the new covenant.... Let the
nations, then, turn their eyes to Italy, their ancient
and loving mother, who holds the seeds of
their regeneration. Italy is the organ of the supreme
reason and the royal and ideal word; the
fountain, rule and guardian of every other reason
and eloquence; for there resides the Head
that rules, the Arm that moves, the Tongue that
commands and the Heart that animates Christianity
at large.... As Rome is the seat of
Christian wisdom, Piedmont is to-day the principal
home of Italian military strength. Seated
on the slopes of the Alps, as a wedge between Austria
and France, and as a guard to the peninsula,
of which it is the vestibule and peristyle, it is destined
to watch from its mountains, and crush in
its ravines, every foreign aggressor, compelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
its powerful neighbors to respect the common independence
of Italy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such expression will suffice to show that Gioberti
was in no sense a reliable prophet, but a
philosopher of deeply religious strain who was
seeking to reconcile the political freedom of Italy
with the suzerainty of the Pope. He discountenanced
all plotting and conspiracy, both of
which were being advocated by Mazzini&rsquo;s appeals
to &ldquo;Young Italy,&rdquo; and built his country out of
a confederation of states. Mazzini, impractical as
he was in many respects, did at least realize that
no such loosely joined federation could stand six
months, and insisted above all in actual political
hegemony of the states.</p>

<p>Gioberti&rsquo;s &ldquo;Primato,&rdquo; deeply suggestive in itself
to intellectual Italy, was given a remarkable
impetus by the election at about the same time
as its appearance of a new Pope. Pius IX.,
elected to the papal chair in June, 1846, seemed the
very man to bring about the realization of Gioberti&rsquo;s
hopes. As Cardinal Mastai Ferreti he had
been immensely popular, and he was known as a
man of great amiability, keenly interested in new
ideas, and ardent in the cause of Italian unity of
action. His first act was to proclaim a general
amnesty for political offenses, by which thousands
of prisoners who had spent years in Roman prisons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
or abroad in exile, many ignorant of the charges
brought against them, were allowed to return to
family and friends. He visited the poor and superintended
the relief of the sick, even working
among the Jewish quarters of Rome. He favored
the construction of railroads, modified the restrictions
of the press, and organized an advisory
council of leading citizens. Small wonder that a
world which had been used to the infinitely narrow-minded
reactionaries Leo XII. and Gregory XVI.
hailed Pius IX. as the regenerator of both church
and state.</p>

<p>To a large degree Pius and Gioberti had both
felt the same enthusiasms, and believed in the same
principles, the cardinal one being that society was
to be reformed by the Roman Church, and the government
of society vested in the Church as a court
of highest appeal. Different desires led the two
men to this conclusion, Gioberti hoping that reform
would come by means of concessions by arbitrary
powers to the rights of the people, and
the Pope believing that humanizing the form of
church government would strengthen its actual
power and increase the devotion of all nations to
the Holy See. History proved that neither Gioberti
nor Pius IX. was correct, but the seeming
coincidence of their views increased the power of
each. Gioberti gained the support of the liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
element in the Church, and the Pope gained the
adhesion of intellectual men throughout Italy.</p>

<p>The new Pope had read Gioberti&rsquo;s political writings,
and had been deeply influenced by them.
The &ldquo;Primato,&rdquo; issued at Brussels in 1842, had
been prohibited in all the Italian states except
Piedmont, and this fact added immensely to its
weight with patriots. Charles Albert read it and
admired it greatly; with the advent of Pius, he as
well as men so diverse as Mazzini, Garibaldi, and
D&rsquo;Azeglio, looked for regeneration. Under the influence
of this new spirit Charles Albert declared
an amnesty for all exiles in 1846, and the philosopher-priest,
after thirteen years of exile, was free
to return home.</p>

<p>Long exile had somewhat crushed the ardent
nature of the churchman, and he waited in Brussels
until he was assured by friends that his return
to Turin would be popular. Learning that
his works, especially the &ldquo;Primato&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Gesuita Moderno,&rdquo; had made him a hero in the
eyes of patriots, he finally returned to Turin in
1848. His entrance into the capital on April
29 of that year was the occasion for the greatest
outburst of enthusiasm, a welcome intensified
by the thought that this man had been banished
for no other cause than the resentment of the hated
Jesuits. The city was decorated and illuminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in his honor, deputations waited upon him, the
King appointed him a Senator, but, as he had been
elected as deputy by both Turin and Genoa to
the Assembly of Representatives now to meet for
the first time under the new constitution, he chose
to sit in the lower house for Turin.</p>

<p>Invitations now poured in upon him from other
cities, and before the Assembly met he made a
tour of the states, commencing with Milan, and
finally reaching Rome. He had three interviews
with the Pope, and these meetings led him still further
to believe that Pius was the man who should
put his political philosophy into practice. He
found the Romans, who of all Italians had most
cause to hate the Jesuits, overjoyed with his work
describing the modern abuses of that order, and
anxious at all hazards that their new Pontiff
should follow the new spirit of liberality.</p>

<p>While he was traveling and speaking publicly to
all the peoples the Assembly met in Turin, and
elected him its president. Count Balbo was Prime
Minister, and in the same Parliament sat many of
the younger element, including Cavour, and a
large liberal section headed by D&rsquo;Azeglio.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there had occurred the memorable
battle-days of 1848, when the February revolution
in Paris set fire to the tinder that had been preparing
throughout Europe. The Milanese arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and drove out the Austrian garrison, Venice proclaimed
the republic under Daniel Manin, and the
cry of &ldquo;a free Italy&rdquo; rang from the Alps to
Sicily. Pius IX., who had already made serious
protest to Austria when in the preceding year
that Power had garrisoned Ferrara, prepared to
place himself actively at the head of the national
movement, and in Piedmont Charles Albert took
the field and went to the aid of Lombardy. At the
close of 1848 Count Balbo resigned, and a new
ministry was formed, in which Gioberti held a seat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Pius IX. lacked the courage of
his convictions, and when he heard that the Austrians
were winning back their lost fields in Lombardy,
his desire to send his troops to the aid of
Piedmont cooled. The conservative elements about
him gained his ear, and he replaced Mamiani, his
Prime Minister, a man who wished him to give
Rome a constitution, with Count Rossi, the French
Ambassador, a man of great ability, but ultra
conservative. In November, 1848, Rossi was assassinated,
and shortly afterward the violence of
the demands of the people convinced Pius that his
best course was temporary flight. Acting upon
this impulse on November 24, 1848, he escaped
from Rome to Gaeta. Italy was beginning to
see to what manner of man it had looked for
deliverance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>From Gaeta the self-exiled Pontiff issued a formal
protest against the violence to which he stated
his people had subjected him, and by which means
alone his latest enactments had been extorted from
him, and declared all measures passed in Rome
during his absence null and void.</p>

<p>In Rome the brief Republic of Mazzini held
sway, and at Gaeta France and Austria sought to
cheer the Pope. Charles Albert, his hope of Papal
aid fading rapidly, attempted for a few months
to stem the tide of French and Austrian influence
over Pius. He tried to effect a reconciliation between
the Holy Father and the Romans, and Gioberti
wrote to the Pope, saying: &ldquo;I hope the
Court of Gaeta is about to return to sentiments
more evangelical, more worthy of Pius IX. I
am sorry to have to say that the Court of Gaeta,
repudiating the doctrine of conciliation, and
adopting that of vengeance and blood, does not
seem to know that it is repudiating the maxims
of Christ, and putting in their stead those of Mahomet.&rdquo;
In addition Gioberti did his best to gain
the Pope&rsquo;s concurrence in a plan for the formation
of an Italian federation of princes, but without
success. The bolt was shot, Pius had had his day
as popular idol, and having proven that Italy had
nothing to hope politically from the Pope, quickly
retroceded to the plane of the Bourbon Princes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Grand Dukes. To Gioberti, who had hoped so
much from the spiritual and temporal power of
Rome, the disillusionment was terrific.</p>

<p>That he was a theorist rather than a practical
statesman he now showed conclusively by advocating
as minister at Turin that Piedmont should
anticipate the inevitable restoration of the rulers
of central Italy by the governments of Austria
and France by restoring them itself. Had this
plan been adopted the House of Savoy would have
been irretrievably ruined in the eyes of patriotic
Italy, and the country left without any champion
of freedom. Fortunately his proposal met with
small favor.</p>

<p>The battle of Novara ended the struggles of
Charles Albert, and Victor Emmanuel, a man of
sterner make, came into control. A new ministry
was formed for the new King by General Delaunay,
who included Gioberti again in the cabinet, although
he held no portfolio. He was not in touch,
however, with the new elements of government, he
could not appreciate a statecraft that was in essence
radical, and after several disagreements he
was appointed on a nominal mission to Paris, which
in reality removed him from any part in the government
at Turin. His best work had been done
in the service of Charles Albert, he was not in touch
with the coming policies of the adroit Cavour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The stirring years of 1848 and 1849 passed, the
dream of the Pope&rsquo;s leadership vanished, and the
yoke of the foreigner seemed to have settled as
heavily as ever upon the states of Italy. Again
exiles gathered in London and Paris, Mazzini returned
to his English fogs, and we find Gioberti
the confidant in Paris of many banished fellow-countrymen.
The Marquis Pallavicino, friend of
Manin and many other patriots, became his bosom
friend. He was offered a pension by his government,
but declined it, and devoted himself to writing.
In 1851 he published his great work, the &ldquo;Rinnovamento
Civile d&rsquo;Italia,&rdquo; in which he pointed
out the mistakes made by Italians in 1848 and
1849, acknowledged his own blunders in political
sagacity, and designated Piedmont as the leader
of a great national movement, which should ultimately
end in a regenerated Italy, with its capital
in a lay and constitutional Rome. He had
met and talked with Cavour in Paris during the
preparation of this book, and he had had the perspicacity
to predict that Cavour was the man who
should unite his land. The statesman was half
amused, half impressed by Gioberti&rsquo;s words, he
had always considered him a man who just failed
of being a great statesman because he was a visionary,
but he was profoundly impressed by the
grasp and depth of his new work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Rinnovamento&rdquo; was indeed true prophecy,
the philosopher had at last seen the futility
of a political confederation of peoples under a religious
head, he realized that Princes supported by
foreign Powers would never unite for any common
end. &ldquo;Except the young sovereign who rules
Piedmont,&rdquo; he says in the &ldquo;Rinnovamento,&rdquo; &ldquo;I
see no one in Italy who could undertake our emancipation.
Instead of imitating Pius, Ferdinand,
and Leopold, who violated their sworn compacts,
he maintains his with religious observance&mdash;vulgar
praise in other times, but to-day not small, being
contrary to example.&rdquo; Victor Emmanuel, reading
the book, was as much impressed by it as Cavour
had been, and time and again repeated, &ldquo;I will do
what Gioberti says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pius IX., still amiable, still suave, was kept in
Rome by French arms, and was solely occupied
in proving his own insufficiency as a temporal
ruler of any sort whatever. He had retracted all
his liberal acts, made friends with all his old foes,
and placed entire charge of state affairs in the
hands of that most unsavory of men, Cardinal Antonelli.
Under him the Jesuits resumed their former
activity, and soon had closed completely about
the Pope. Then it was that the works of Gioberti,
the &ldquo;Primato&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Prolegomeni,&rdquo;
which had once so greatly delighted the Pope, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
placed upon the Index Expurgatorius and publicly
condemned by the Church. The action had
no other effect than to amuse the world; Italy and
all friends of Italy had read and pondered the
great treatises, and drawn their own conclusions
from them irrespective of the wishes of the Roman
See.</p>

<p>Gioberti died in Paris October 16, 1852, just
as the new era in Italian affairs which he had
predicted in his last book was actually commencing
with the advent of Cavour as Prime Minister
of Piedmont.</p>

<p>When we review Gioberti&rsquo;s work we find that it
was chiefly important as a stimulus to Italian
patriotic thought, as a threshing out of theories
and principles in preparation for a true realization
of national needs and hopes. That the philosophy,
in so far as it was political, of his &ldquo;Primato&rdquo;
failed to prove true when attempted in practice,
and must inevitably so have failed as we see now,
did not affect his influence over his own generation.
That influence was one which contrasted
sharply with Mazzini&rsquo;s, Gioberti always preaching
orderly organization, Mazzini daring attempts
of many sorts, both alike in the ardor of their
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>While Mazzini appealed to the mass, Gioberti
appealed to the scholars, the clergy, the think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>ing
classes, and his appeal was patriotic as well
as intellectual. In his &ldquo;Primato&rdquo; he stirs his
countrymen to consider their country&rsquo;s place
among the nations. &ldquo;While to the north,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;there is a people numbering only twenty-four
millions who rule the sea, make Europe tremble,
own India, vanquish China and occupy the
best parts of Asia, Africa, America and Oceania,
what great things have we Italians done? What
are our manual and intellectual exploits? Where
are our fleets and our colonies? What rank do
our legates hold; what force do they wield; what
wise or authoritative influence do they exert in
foreign courts? What weight attaches to the
Italian name in the balance of European power?
Foreigners, indeed, know and still visit our country,
but only for the purpose of enjoying the
changeless beauty of our skies and of looking upon
the ruins of our past. But what profits it to
speak of glory, riches, and power? Can Italy say
she has a place in the world? Can she boast of a
life of her own and of a political autonomy, when
she is awed by the first insolent and ambitious upstart
who tramples her under foot and galls her
with his yoke? Who is there who shudders not
when he reflects that, disunited as we are, we must
be the prey of any assailant whatever, and that
we owe even that wretched fraction of independ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>ence
which charters and protocols still allow us
to the compassion of our neighbors?&rdquo; Then he
concludes, &ldquo;Although all this has come upon us
through our own fault; nevertheless, by the exercise
of a little strength of will and determination,
without upheavals or revolutions and without
perpetrating injustice, we can still be one of the
first races in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With consummate skill he arranged a national
program in which the Pope, the Princes, the people,
even Austria, should have a part, and it was
scarcely to be wondered that inasmuch as each interest
was flattered each thought well of the program.
The clergy were no less delighted with the
eloquence of one of their own number than with
his teaching that religion and patriotism should
go hand in hand, those high in power felt that
their power would be left them under his theory,
and the people were stirred by his eloquence and
dreams of what Italy should become. As a result
there arose what was known as the &ldquo;Neo-Guelph&rdquo;
party, which, harking back to the Middle
Ages, sought to place the Pope at the head
of the national movement. And, by a beautiful
coincidence of history, just at that moment a new
Pontiff, one of that clergy which had so greatly
admired Gioberti&rsquo;s writings, ascended St. Peter&rsquo;s
throne. In these facts you have the cause of Gio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>berti&rsquo;s
commanding position in the early years of
the great struggle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Gioberti&rsquo;s theories were dreams,
not even so practical as the aspirations of Mazzini&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Young Italy.&rdquo; He had failed utterly to
grasp the need of absolute administrative concentration
and did not accurately estimate the jealousies
and prides of the petty Princes and the
churchmen. He believed that those forces which
had so long destroyed Italian unity could be made
to unite to restore it, he believed that the Roman
Church could exercise a wise temporal authority.
He looked back to the Middle Ages, and spoke
with some of Savonarola&rsquo;s words. He appealed
to his people&rsquo;s ancient love of art and letters, to the
glories of the medi√¶val cities, to the world-wide
authority of Rome and St. Peter&rsquo;s. The appeal
stirred the imagination of the intellectual classes,
and drew the attention of other countries to the
fallen estate of Italy. Beyond that it could not
be effective; the needs of State and Church, of
Princes and people, had grown too unalterably opposed.
Mazzini was far nearer right, a truer
teacher, a surer guide.</p>

<p>The time came when Gioberti recognized that
Italy&rsquo;s salvation lay in the strong hand, and this
he acknowledged in his last book. It is the truest
of all his political philosophies because he had then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
understood that the future belonged to men of such
abilities as were possessed by Cavour and Victor
Emmanuel, and to a well-knit nation rather
than to a confraternity of ill-assorted states.</p>

<p>Yet for all its fallacies Gioberti&rsquo;s &ldquo;Primato&rdquo;
woke intellectual Italy from a sleep which had
lasted centuries, and made it consider the problem
of its regeneration.</p>

<h2><a name="MANIN_THE_FATHER_OF_VENICE" id="MANIN_THE_FATHER_OF_VENICE">MANIN, THE &ldquo;FATHER OF VENICE&rdquo;</a></h2>


<p class="start-chap"><span class="smcap">The</span> story of Venetian glory seemed closed
with the last years of the Eighteenth Century.
The proud Queen of the Adriatic had seen
her jewels stolen one by one, and had finally become
the toy of wanton powers. Venice was no
longer self-reliant, no longer coldly virtuous, her
grandeur had sunk into a memory, her civic honor
been bedimmed by gross corruption. &ldquo;Venice
was,&rdquo; said the world, and France, parceling out
the conquests of the young Napoleon, handed Venetia
and the City of the Doges to Austria. There
was no opportunity for self-defense, Napoleon had
removed all military stores and confiscated the
Venetian fleet, the citizens buried the lion-banners
of Saint Mark beneath their churches, and silently
watched the Austrians enter. The last Doge,
aged and bent with years, fell senseless as he
opened his lips to swear allegiance to the House of
Hapsburg. Europe considered the fate of Venice
sealed.</p>

<p>Napoleon came and went, and men as well as
maps experienced gigantic changes, but still Venice
slept. She had become a part of the Austrian Em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>pire,
a new generation grew up who had never
known Venice free, who only learned their city&rsquo;s
history by stealth. Among this new generation
was Daniel Manin, son of a Jew who had embraced
Christianity and who had adopted the surname
of his noble patron the last Doge, according
to Venetian custom. So it happened that the last
free ruler of Venice and the man who was to raise
her from sleep bore the same name. There was
also transmitted to the boy the ancient hate of
Austria.</p>

<p>Born in 1804 Daniel Manin early showed a
strong love of learning, which was eagerly tended
by his father, a lawyer of some note. The father
taught his son the history of his city, he brought
him up to see the unjust practices of Napoleon
and of Austria, he kindled in him the passion for
liberty. The boy studied jurisprudence and the
growth of Venetian dialects, at fifteen he translated
the apocryphal book of Enoch from the
Hebrew, at seventeen he became a Doctor of Laws,
and had translated Pothier&rsquo;s great French work
on Roman law before he was twenty-one. The year
he came of age he married, and a little later settled
in the small town of Maestra, which lies at
the entrance to the Lagoons, and started to practise
his profession of advocate, which under Austrian
rule allowed him only to act in civil cases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and then merely in a consulting capacity and never
as a pleader in the courts.</p>

<p>Even in early youth his health was poor; although
his mind was unusually active and well-balanced
he was subject to frequent visitations of
great physical weariness which at times made it
impossible for him to accomplish anything. Later
in life he wrote, &ldquo;The act of living, in a healthy
person, considered in itself, ought to be a pleasure;
but to me from my very childhood, it has always
been a painful effort. I always feel weary.&rdquo; He
was frequently morbid just at the time when his
growing family required all his energy for support.</p>

<p>In person the young lawyer was rather striking,
not tall, but spare, with unusually animated
blue eyes, thick chestnut hair, and features full of
changing expression, quick to show the temper of
his mind. For all his underlying weariness and
continued depression he often appeared gay and
cheerful on the surface; it was his nature to be
unselfish, and to turn a brave face towards the
world.</p>

<p>Working as an advocate Manin gave up his
spare hours to studying Venetian <i>patois</i> and to
planning how in time his city might loosen the
bonds of Austrian tyranny. As early as 1830,
when he was only twenty-six, he joined with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
close friends in a plot to seize the Venetian arsenal,
and drew up a proclamation intended to excite the
citizens. The movement throughout northern
Italy on which the friends relied failed to materialize,
and the plan fell through. Fortunately
the authors of the proclamation were not discovered,
and Manin was permitted to continue his
profession. He did not believe in secret societies,
and would not join them; he devoted himself to
studying Austria&rsquo;s colonial weaknesses.</p>

<p>The first step which brought him seriously to
the notice of the government was his work on behalf
of the Italian bankers who were associated
with some Germans in building a railway between
Venice and Milan. There had been a disagreement
as to the route of the railway, and the Austrian
viceroy had sided with the Germans. Manin was
engaged to represent the Italian bankers, and conducted
his side of the case with great skill. The
Austrian government finally concluded the matter
by arbitrarily dissolving the Italian Railways Association.
The case had however shown Manin
a possible mode of attacking the foreign despotism,
finding flaws in its laws and concentrating on
such weaknesses until eventually its whole fabric
was loosened. He did not believe that any sudden
local revolution could succeed, he saw only the loss
of valuable lives thereby, but he did believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the way for some later far-sweeping rising might
be paved by consecutive breaches in the enemy&rsquo;s
legal walls. This opinion was the result of his
evenly-balanced, deliberate judgment; he could at
times, as he was to show later, throw himself passionately
into a cause, without regard to consequences,
but his nature was not that of the ardent
revolutionary; he relied on cool, sober judgments,
and was not readily led from them by illusions. In
his notes we find him writing, &ldquo;Against disorder
I feel a repulsion not only of reason but of instinct,
the same as I feel against everything contrary
to the laws of harmony, a deformed face, a
discordant sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His advocacy of the Italian bankers brought
Manin before the Venetian public, he was recognized
as an able speaker with a deep knowledge of
law. He spoke before the Venetian Athen√¶um
on the obligation of thinkers to inspire and stimulate
men of action. The subject gave him a chance
to draw attention to the present lethargy of
Venice and to urge consideration of new ideas affecting
trade and commerce. He hoped to unite
northern Italians through the new principle of
free trade. Fortunately Cobden, the great English
advocate of free trade, was traveling in
Italy; he visited Venice and met Manin and some
of the other Venetian leaders of opinion just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
he had met Cavour at Turin and Massimo d&rsquo;Azeglio
at Genoa.</p>

<p>Various small events gave the lawyer a chance
to speak publicly to his fellow-citizens. At the
Scientific Congress which met in September, 1847,
he was appointed a commissioner to investigate the
charitable institutions of Venice, and in doing this
work he came upon the case of a poor infirm workman
who had placed a placard upon a public wall
complaining that the government had left him
to starve, and for which action had been placed
in a lunatic asylum. Manin reported the case and
wrote, &ldquo;The physicians acknowledge the man is
sane; but they dare not set him at liberty, fearing
it would be contrary to the views of the police and
government. For my part, I have a better opinion
of the government and the police. I do not admit
that they create madmen by decrees. If Padovini
is culpable there are the laws.&rdquo; Count Palffy,
the Governor, was very much vexed. &ldquo;We must
release Padovini from the madhouse,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
put Manin in his place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About the same time Count Jablonski, a relation
of the Venetian Governor, wrote a paper urging
the Italians to become resigned. In reply Manin
set down his thoughts in a page which seems to
sum up his whole purpose, a wonderful expression
of his philosophy. It was not published at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that time, but was later found among his papers.
It read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the fashion to preach resignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I distinguish two kinds of resignation; the
one virtuous and manly; the other cowardly, and
worthy only of fools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The strong man, when overcome by misfortune,
seeks the means of remedying it. Does he find
any? In spite of difficulties, he applies himself
to the task, excited, cheerful, and vigorous, full
of energy and pertinacity. It is only when he is
certain that no remedy exists, that he becomes
resigned. This is manly resignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coward, when misfortune overtakes him,
allows himself to be cast down, and seeks no means
of remedying it. However spontaneous and easy
relief may present itself to his mind, he attempts
nothing, he wishes neither to trouble nor expose
himself&mdash;he is resigned: this is the resignation of
the fool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore, resignation is virtuous and manly
under evils manifestly without remedy; it is cowardly
and stupid when we can in any way free ourselves
from these evils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the individual, resignation may often be virtuous;
in a nation it is perhaps never so, for the
misfortunes of a nation are seldom irremediable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To overcome the misfortunes of a nation, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
can employ the whole intellectual, moral, and physical
power of all its citizens; and if the generation
which commences the generous task does not succeed
in accomplishing it, other generations follow,
who will attain success; for nations never die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the reason why those who advise resignation
to nations, advise cowardice, and the nations
which become resigned are cowards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therein lies the whole wisdom of Manin&rsquo;s political
philosophy, and also that of many of the earlier
Italian patriots. How could Austria hope to keep
such men forever in subjection?</p>

<p>Manin&rsquo;s avowed purpose was to show again and
again that the Austrians were not obeying the laws
which they had themselves given to the subject
provinces. One of the methods of Austrian administrative
rule was the use of supposedly representative
councils called the Central and Provincial
Congregations, which were designed to communicate
the wishes of the people of Venice and Lombardy
in the form of petitions to the Imperial
council, and which had failed lamentably to use
even that meager power. On December 9, 1847,
Nazari, a deputy to the Lombard Congregation,
moved that the grievances of the country be represented
to the Imperial government. Not a single
Venetian deputy followed his lead, but Manin,
as a private individual, signed a petition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Venetian Congregation calling upon them to speak
for the people. His comments were brief but vigorous.
&ldquo;The Congregations,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have
never been the interpreters of our wants or wishes&mdash;their
silence has arisen from a fear of displeasing
the government; but this fear is unjust, and
injurious: for it is unjust and injurious to suppose
that the government has granted to this kingdom
a derisory national representation, that it
deceived, and still deceives, this country and Europe,
in making laws which it does not wish to be
observed, and in prosecuting and punishing those
who intend observing them.&rdquo; The Venetians were
delighted with the petition, they were beginning to
feel the first thrills of a new civic life. On December
30, Manin and Tommaseo, a brilliant poet and
public-spirited citizen, drew up another address
which in bold terms denounced the Austrian censorship
of the press contrary to a specific clause in the
law of 1815. All the members of the Ateneo, the
literary club of Venice, signed the petition that
went with the address.</p>

<p>The Austrians failed to see in the unrest that
appeared throughout Italy at the close of 1847
more than a series of local and widely-separated
disturbances, and made small effort to appease any
of the leaders. For their part in preparing the
Venetian petition Manin and Tommaseo were ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>rested
and thrown into prison on January 18,
1848, charged with high treason. The temper
of the newly-aroused people was uncertain, on the
morning after the arrest the streets of Venice
were seen blossoming with signs ominous to peace
and Austrian supremacy, &ldquo;Viva l&rsquo;Italia!&rdquo; &ldquo;Viva
Manin e Tommaseo!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Morte ai Tedeschi!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the date of his imprisonment Manin underwent
many sufferings, one of the chief being his
inability longer to help in nursing a daughter to
whom he was passionately devoted and who was
suffering from a tedious and most painful nervous
disease. At almost the same time his younger
sister, who was ill in Trevisa, died from the shock
of hearing of his imprisonment. He had been able
to save very little for dark days, now that they
were come he could do nothing to tide his little
household through them. Outwardly he was calm
and strong of will, inwardly he was tormented by
a hundred fears. Yet he could write from prison
to his brave wife, saying, &ldquo;If you continue to be
strong and courageous, these will be the happiest
days of my life.... You will find a few pieces
of gold in one drawer, a little silver in another....
If this affair lasts long, we must think of
providing for you in some way. Love one another,
my angels: be resigned, that is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A valiant attempt was made by Teresa Manin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
secure her husband&rsquo;s release on bail, the authorities
put her off continually, and finally the Director-General
replied that he did not believe himself
authorized to accede to her request. This final reply
caused an outburst of popular indignation.
The Venetians dressed themselves in mourning, and
with heads bared filed slowly before the windows
of the prison on the Riva dei Schiavoni, where
Manin and Tommaseo were confined. As long as
he remained in prison the other advocates united
in caring for Manin&rsquo;s legal practice, and high-spirited
friends among all classes insisted on providing
his family with all necessities. He himself
hoped to be able to support them by reprinting
a small treatise on Venetian jurisprudence,
but permission to advertise its sale was denied him
by the government. A little later, however, Austrian
permissions became no longer necessary, and
Manin&rsquo;s family lived on the proceeds of the sale
of this work and on the small legacy left to him
by his sister. He had little time to think of self-support
when he became dictator.</p>

<p>The ancient spirit of Venice was slowly rising as
day after day news came that men throughout
Italy were turning on their despots. The Nicoletti
and the Castellani, the two historic factions of
the people, the blacks and the reds, renounced their
ancient feud and took a common secret oath to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
war only with Austria until Venice was free. The
young nobles resigned their Austrian offices and
ranks, they had heard what the nobility of Milan
were accomplishing. The examination into the
charges against Manin and Tommaseo continued,
although nothing illegal could be proved against
them there was a prospect of their arbitrary removal
out of Venice and to that prison of Spielberg
where the careers of so many gifted Italian
patriots had ended. Manin heard that the French
had driven their King from his throne, he wondered
what effect the growing tumult of that revolution
year would have on Venice. He did not have
to wait long to learn. The flames of revolt had
spread across Europe even to Vienna, Metternich
had fled from the city in peril of his life, the Austrian
throne was tottering. Manin saw what was
coming, and made his plans even while he was in
prison to secure Venice against anarchy.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 17, 1848, the Venetians
hastened to the dock to learn the latest news
of Vienna from the Trieste packet. A French merchant
on board called to the gondoliers the news,
&ldquo;A Constitution at Vienna! The Recognition of
Italian Independence! A Free Press! A National
Guard!&rdquo; The words were sufficient, the people
rushed to the Governor&rsquo;s palace and demanded the
immediate release of Manin and Tommaseo. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Governor wavered, declaimed, finally yielded, saying,
&ldquo;I do what I ought not to do.&rdquo; The people
swept to the prison, and beating down the
doors, discovered the two captives. &ldquo;You are
free!&rdquo; the leaders shouted. Manin still chose to
follow the usage of law, and asked to see the warrant
for his release. It was produced, and then
he and his fellow captive were led forth from the
dreary cells with loud acclaims of joy. Manin was
raised in a chair, and so carried to the great
Square of St. Mark&rsquo;s, the scene of so many triumphs
in Venetian history. The yellow and black flag of
Austria had in some mysterious fashion fluttered
down from the ancient flag-staves that guard the
square and in its place floated the red, white, and
green emblem. &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; cried the people, and
Manin, pale, infirm, and gaunt from prison life,
rose and spoke with his remarkably persuasive
voice. He said he did not know to what great
events he owed his freedom, but could see clearly
that nationality and patriotic fire had grown wonderfully
during the past few months. &ldquo;But forget
not, I beg,&rdquo; he implored, &ldquo;that true and lasting
liberty can only rest on order, and that you
must make yourselves the emulous guardians of
order if you would show that you are worthy to be
free.&rdquo; He paused a moment, then added, &ldquo;Yet
there are times pointed out to us by Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
when insurrection becomes not only a right, but a
duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manin returned home, already intent on plans to
regulate the new order of things. Towards night
the great bell in the Ducal Chapel sounded the
warning note, the people rushed to the Piazza to
find a battalion of Croats tearing down the Italian
tricolor, the people resisted, the soldiers cleared the
square with a bayonet charge, but the Venetians
had tasted triumph too fully to be dismayed. Some
of them went to Manin and asked him to lead them
against the Croats. &ldquo;This is not the way,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;we must have a civic guard.&rdquo; He sent
a messenger to the Governor. &ldquo;Tell him that to-day
his life was in my hands, and that I preached
order, not vengeance; and now, in the interest of
his own life as well as of order, he must at once
organize a civic guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Count Palffy hesitated and put off the demand
from day to day. He sent messengers to
the Viceroy at Verona, and the latter telegraphed
him permission to enroll two hundred citizens.
Three thousand at once took arms and called on
Manin to give them his commands. &ldquo;Let all who
will not absolutely obey me depart,&rdquo; he said, but
no one left. At last Venice again had an army of
her own.</p>

<p>There was no immediate bloodshed. The leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
citizens conferred as to what course Venice should
take if the revolution in Vienna succeeded. Some
were for joining the kingdom of Charles Albert,
some for uniting with Lombardy, some for an Austrian
ruler under a constitution. Manin scattered
their diverse views, he told them that their immediate
need was freedom, that their city must
actually be in their own charge before considering
her destiny. Rumors came that the city was about
to be bombarded, there was danger both from the
arsenal and from the sea, and on the night of
March 21 Manin laid his plans before the chief
patriots and told them that they must seize the
arsenal. &ldquo;The people of Venice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can
only understand one cry, &lsquo;Let the Republic live!&rsquo;&rdquo;
Still the others hesitated; one said, &ldquo;The people
are incapable of sacrifices!&rdquo; &ldquo;You do not know
them,&rdquo; cried Manin. &ldquo;I know them; that is my
sole merit, you will see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Newcomers arrived, and still Manin, worn with
argument, pressed his opinion. He finished, saying,
&ldquo;We must have the Republic, and join with it
Saint Mark. The Republic and Saint Mark will
echo in Dalmatia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Viva San Marco!&rdquo; came an answering cry.
&ldquo;It is the only one, the rallying cry of Venice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conference agreed; Manin sent for the commander-in-chief
of the civic guard. &ldquo;The city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
is threatened with bombardment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
wish to take the arsenal at all hazards. You must
make me commander-in-chief for a day. Form the
six battalions into two brigades, and give me their
captains for eight hours.&rdquo; The general, astounded
at the advocate&rsquo;s demand, left without making a
reply. Manin sent to the other commanders making
the same demand. One by one they refused,
claiming that the project was too wild.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the soldiers at the arsenal were in
mutiny and had killed the second officer in command;
there was danger of the spirit of anarchy
spreading. At the same time the last of the commanders,
Major Olivieri, placed his single battalion
at Manin&rsquo;s command. The advocate seized
his sword, called his son, a boy of sixteen, to follow
him, and put himself at the head of the two
hundred guards. The little band marched on the
arsenal and forced the commander to surrender;
almost before the Austrian officers knew what had
happened the Venetians were distributing the military
stores among the people. At the moment of
taking the arsenal Manin had sent word to call
the whole people into St. Mark&rsquo;s Square. He
found the ancient banner, the wing√©d lion, and raising
it from the dust where it had lain for fifty
years he unfurled it before his company and led
them back across the Piazzetta into the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
square. He had told the people he would meet
them there at noon; now he stood before them, bearing
the emblem that proclaimed that Venice had
risen from her lengthy slumbers. He spoke to the
assembled city. &ldquo;Venetians, we are free! And we
are so without the shedding of blood, either our
own, or our brothers&rsquo;, for to me all men are brothers.
But when the old government is overturned,
the new must take its place; the best now seems to
me to be the Republic which speaks of our past
glory and adds the liberty of modern times. But
by this we shall not separate from our Italian
brothers, but rather form one of those centers
destined to aid in fusing our Italy into one people.
Live the Republic! Live liberty! Live Saint
Mark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The civic guards swore to defend with their lives
the new Republic and its founder, the aged wept,
the young embraced, all raised their hands in gratitude
to heaven. The people reveled in noble delirium
of joy. Venice looked upon Manin as its
deliverer; the citizens did not know the physical
anguish he had undergone. Pathetic are the
words of his little daughter Emilia as she heard
her father proclaimed. &ldquo;I ought,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;to
be filled with ineffable gladness, but a weight continually
presses my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manin had scarcely closed his eyes for five days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and nights. As soon as the people would release
him now he went home utterly exhausted: he said
to his friends, &ldquo;Leave me at least this night to
rest, or I shall die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Austrian authorities saw that resistance
would be of little avail, their own forces were too
small and too much in sympathy with the people&rsquo;s
cause to give them a sense of any real power on
which to rely, and accordingly the Governor acceded
to the terms imposed upon him. All foreign
troops were to be removed, the forts and all military
stores surrendered, the government transferred
to the charge of a Committee of Venetian
citizens. The demands were sweeping, the Austrian
government later regarded the Venetian capitulation
as the most humiliating they suffered
in the revolutionary year of 1848.</p>

<p>That same night the provisional government announced
to the people the terms of the Austrian
capitulation, and the citizens were amazed to find
that neither the name of Manin nor of Tommaseo
was included in the new government. They made
their dissatisfaction so apparent that friends went
to see Manin to beg him to send some message to
the people. He dictated the following lines from
his bed: &ldquo;Venetians! I know that you love me,
and, in the name of that love, I ask you to conduct
yourselves, during the legitimate manifestation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
your joy, with that dignity which belongs to men
worthy of being free. Your friend, Manin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people heard the message and quietly dispersed.
Next day the provisional government
found that the new Republic would only have the
one man at its head, and so they asked Manin to
form a government. He did so immediately, taking
for himself the Presidency of the Council and
Foreign Affairs. He composed his government of
men of different classes and different religions, all
Venetians were assured of perfect equality in their
new state. The patriarch blessed the standard of
the Republic, and the commander of the fleet read
the list of the ministry to the people. The reading
was broken by constant cries of &ldquo;Viva Manin!
President of the Republic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Venice became free after fifty years of
bondage. It was now Manin&rsquo;s concern to see that
she was kept free. He recognized how slight were
her resources, and he became at once an eager
adherent of French intervention in northern Italy.
Charles Albert of Piedmont and Mazzini were both
acclaiming an Italy won by the Italians, but Manin
foresaw, what Cavour was later to recognize, that
foreign allies were absolutely essential.</p>

<p>France, however, was in a most unsettled condition,
her ministers did not wish to see a strong
state of upper Italy on their southern borders;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they were already longing to annex Savoy, and yet
as good republicans they felt themselves bound to
aid the revolted states against Austrian tyranny.
Manin made overtures for an alliance, at first
merely feeling his way, but as the summer progressed,
and the need grew more and more apparent,
by definite overtures. The French Consul at
Venice was most hopeful. He said to Manin, &ldquo;It
is well known that the sympathy of France, when
she possesses liberty of action, is never without results.&rdquo;
In reply Manin said that he hoped &ldquo;that
the united efforts of the different Italian states,
the ardor which animates the people of the Peninsula,
will suffice to expel the enemy; if not, we shall
have recourse to the generosity of France. Meanwhile,
we should be glad to see at once some French
vessels in the Adriatic, and I beg that you will
lose no time in communicating our wishes to the
foreign ministry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manin wished to convene a popular assembly as
soon after he assumed office as possible, and on
June 3 such a deliberative body met, its members
having been elected by universal suffrage from
Venice and the free districts of the Dogado.
Their first important task was to decide whether
they would join with Lombardy in union under
Piedmont&rsquo;s King. Manin believed that the decision
as to such a step ought to be deferred until the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was ended, but a strong party opposed his opinion.
His partisans entered into a bitter fight with the
opposition, for a time it looked as though the split
in the Assembly would lead to civil war. Manin
rose and implored those who were his friends to
place no further obstacles in the path of fusion.
Moved by his passionate appeal for harmony the
Assembly passed the act of fusion with few negative
votes, and at the same time resolved that
&ldquo;Daniel Manin had deserved well of his country.&rdquo;
He spoke again, saying, &ldquo;While the foreigner is
still in Italy, for God&rsquo;s sake let there be no more
talk of parties. When we are rid of him we will
discuss these matters among ourselves as brothers.
This is the only recompense I ask of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Assembly elected Manin head of the new
ministry, but he declined on the ground that he had
always been a republican and would feel out of
place as a royal minister. In addition his health
demanded that he seek some rest.</p>

<p>The new Venetian ministry lasted until August
7, when the Royal Commissioners assumed office.
Unfortunately Charles Albert was already being
beaten back in Lombardy, and on August 9 signed
the armistice of Salasco, by which all claims to
Venice were renounced. When word came to the
city the Venetians were dumbfounded, then mad
with indignation. Finally they rushed to Manin&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
house, calling for him and denouncing the Royal
Commissioners. Manin told the excited people
that he would stake his head upon the Commissioners&rsquo;
patriotism. He went to see them and then addressed
the citizens again. &ldquo;The day after tomorrow,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;the Assembly will meet to appoint
a new government. For these forty-eight
hours I govern.&rdquo; The people dispersed, satisfied
now that their idol was at their head again. The
Assembly when it met wished to make Manin dictator,
but he pleaded his ignorance of military
matters, and a triumvirate was formed, made up of
Admiral Graziani, Colonel Cavedalis, and himself.</p>

<p>Just when it seemed as though France was finally
deciding to come to the aid of northern Italy,
England intervened and proposed a plan of joint
mediation. To add to this obstacle Charles Albert
declared that Italy would act for herself, and the
chances of Venice winning a foreign ally were reduced
to practically nothing. Italians from Naples
to Piedmont were showing themselves to be
individual heroes, but their efforts were ineffectual
without a general leader. The Romans were hampered
by the inaction of the Pope. Pius IX. had
promised great things in the cause of national independence,
but when the German Cardinals told
him that in case he declared war against Austria
he would forfeit their allegiance his enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
waned. The Austrian general, Radetzky, was
slowly winning back the fields lost in Lombardy,
Vicenza fell, then Milan, and Austria felt herself
strong enough to declare a blockade of Venice. As
the summer of 1848 ended it became clear that
Venice would be left to herself, that the tide of
revolution in the other states was already ebbing,
and that Piedmont had shot her bolt. Manin still
hoped that some ally would succor the small city
in her war against the great empire, but whether
an ally should come or not he was determined that
Venice should set an example of resistance that
would show Europe how well freedom was deserved.</p>

<p>The city, in its state of siege, stood in the greatest
need of money. Manin had only to ask, and all
classes brought forth their savings, their heirlooms,
whatever they had of value, to give to the
cause. The old aristocracy, the boys in the street,
every one who loved Venice, made their sacrifices
gladly, reverently. Private citizens clothed many
of the soldiers, palaces were given for public uses,
Manin gave all his family plate and would accept
no salary; General Pepe, the aged commander-in-chief,
gave a picture by Leonardo da Vinci that
was his dearest possession. No one thought of
his own need, all thought solely of keeping Venice
free. If she returned to bondage they cared little
what became of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Ugo Bassi, the heroic priest who was later to
fight with Mazzini on the walls of Rome, and still
later to die at the hands of Austrian executioners,
preached daily to the Venetians. There was no
lack of noble spirits who recalled to them the
great glories of the past. But above and beyond
all the others the people loved Manin, they had
come to link his name indissolubly with that of
their city, he was their father, they his devoted
children. If ever a man merited such devotion it
was Manin. With the cares of his city weighing
perpetually on his mind, planning, advising, encouraging,
he fought the ravages of disease that
crippled his resources, and spent the nights watching
by the bedside of his sick child. At one time,
in November, there was fear for his life, and
Venice shook with apprehension. He recovered and
took up the burden of government with his marvelous
stoic calm.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the city was besieged
and money scarce, Venice was characteristically
buoyant. The theater, the Fenice, was crowded;
f√™tes and carnivals, always patriotically fervent,
were of daily occurrence; processions, music, all
that appealed to the eye and the ear and the
imagination fed the Venetian love of glory. Their
city was free, and the people awakened the echoes
of that great life which had been theirs before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
captivity, they forgot so far as they could that
they had ever slumbered. On the morning of November
17 Mass was celebrated in memory of all
the martyrs to Italian liberty, and that same
night the entire city was thrilled by a wonderful
display of the Aurora Borealis which set the
snow-caps of the Alps vividly before their eyes.
They lived on faith, and hope, and trust in Daniel
Manin, and found propitious omens with sea-dwellers&rsquo;
skill.</p>

<p>In December some Roman volunteers left Venice
to join their fellow citizens, and with them went
Ugo Bassi. He bade Manin a touching farewell,
foreseeing what lay before both his own city and
Venice. He had venerated the Pope who had held
out such noble hopes to all Italians, but he could do
so no more, and in his place put the hero of
Venice. As he left the city he kissed the stone
plate on Manin&rsquo;s door, saying, &ldquo;Next to God and
Italy, before the Pope&mdash;Manin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Assembly which had voted for fusion with
Piedmont was dissolved, and a new one elected.
Manin was determined that his government should
have the fullest power over the city. He deemed
this essential to any hopes of ultimate success.
Some members of the Assembly disagreed with
him, and advocated restriction. &ldquo;It is not a
question of power,&rdquo; replied Manin, &ldquo;but of saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the country. If we are to be hampered on every
turn by forms and limitations, we cannot act with
the promptitude and vigor needful for the preservation
of public order (I beg pardon of whoever
the expression may offend), and our defense
depends more upon that than upon the force of
arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people got wind of the fact that certain
of the Assembly were jealous of Manin&rsquo;s power,
and they marched to the Ducal Palace. Manin
spoke and dispersed them, but again and again
they gathered, making various demonstrations of
their trust in him. At length he heard that they
had devised a plan to march into the Council
Hall and coerce the Deputies who wanted to fetter
their &ldquo;caro Manin.&rdquo; Fearful of civic strife Manin
called his son, and standing alone with him, sword
in hand, at the door of the Palace, told the people
that they could only enter after killing father
and son. He bade them go quietly home, and they
obeyed. That night he issued a proclamation.
&ldquo;Brothers, you have caused me great pain to-day.
To show your affection for me you have
risen in tumult, yet you know how I hate tumult
... as you say you love me, I entreat you to
show it by your actions.... To-morrow let there
be no shouting, no meetings. Remain at home.
Trust in the government and the Assembly, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
regard your welfare as dearer to them than life.&rdquo;
He was always the father speaking to his children.</p>

<p>The Assembly listened to the advice of its wisest
members, and abandoning all dissension, chose
Manin as President of the Republic, giving him
complete power both as to internal administration
and as to relations with foreign states. Manin
spoke in reply: &ldquo;In accepting the charge which
this Assembly has entrusted to me, I am conscious
of committing an act of insensate boldness.
I accept it. But in order that my good name, and,
what is of more importance, your good name and
that of Venice, may not be tarnished through this
transaction, it behooves that I should be seconded
and sustained in my arduous undertaking by your
co-operation, confidence, and affection. We have
been strong, respected, eulogized, up till now, because
we have been united. I ask of you virtues
which, if they are not romantic, are at all events
of great practical utility. I ask of you patience,
prudence, perseverance. With these, and with concord,
love, and faith, all things are overcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charles Albert again took the field and for a
brief interval the Austrians were repulsed. Brescia
made a heroic stand, and the Venetians heard the
news of the little city&rsquo;s courage with shouts of
acclamation and an added determination to fight
Austria to the uttermost. The Venetian fleet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
kept in constant readiness, the troops slept with
their arms, there was only the one thought, to
keep the lion-flag of St. Mark flying from the
<i>pili</i>.</p>

<p>Then on March 28, 1849, came letters from
Turin telling of the utter defeat of Novara and of
Charles Albert&rsquo;s abdication in favor of his son.</p>

<p>The first effect of the news on Venice was absolute
stupefaction, then a wild rush to the Square
of St. Mark&rsquo;s. A tremendous crowd called, as
usual in its troubles, for its &ldquo;father, Manin!&rdquo;
Said a foreigner who was a witness of the scene,
&ldquo;The faith of Venice in this man was inconceivable,
complete, and absolute. He had never deceived,
never abused it. The people seemed to attribute to
him omnipotence and omniscience, and believed him
capable of guarding Venice from every peril, and
of rescuing her from every calamity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The President appeared on the Palace balcony.
He said that he had not yet received official confirmation
of the news from Turin, but his sad
expression and his few words showed his belief that
the news might prove only too true. Venice passed
a night of bitterest gloom, more hopeless even than
in the later days when Austrian bombs exploded
in the streets. Three similar days followed, and
then came official confirmation of the news. Lombardy
was Austrian once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The city withstood the shock, and took up its
life of outward cheer and hope. On April 25,
St. Mark&rsquo;s Day, there was a grand <i>festa</i>, and
Manin spoke. &ldquo;Who holds out wins,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;We have held out, and we shall win. Long
live St. Mark! This cry, that the seas rang with
in old days, we must raise again. Europe looks
on, and will praise. We must, we ought to win.
To the Sea! To the Sea! To the Sea!&rdquo; There
was tremendous thrill in his magnetic voice,
in his deep blue eyes, in the glow of his pallid face;
Venice cried aloud with eager hope.</p>

<p>With this spring of 1849 came the great days.
When the Assembly had voted to resist Austria
at all costs, the people adopted a red ribbon as
their emblem. A historian of that time says:
&ldquo;From the top of the <i>Campanile</i> of St. Mark, far
above the domes, the roofs, and the spires of the palace
and the basilica, beside the golden angel that
seemed to watch over the city, they planted a
huge red banner, which stood out like a spot of
blood against the azure sky, which was seen by
the enemy&rsquo;s fleet afar off in the Adriatic, and by
their army on the distant mainland. It defied them
both, and announced to them that Venice would
fight to the last drop of blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Placards were fixed to every wall, at the corner
of every street. They read: &ldquo;Venice resists!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Church plate, women&rsquo;s golden ornaments, bronze
bells, copper cooking utensils, the iron of the
enemy&rsquo;s cannon balls&mdash;all will be useful. Anything
rather than the Croats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Night and day workmen had been building ships,
now the little fleet fought through the lagunes as
had the great fleets of the olden days. The land
forces held the shore batteries, and these forces
were composed of all the city. One artillery company,
famous as the Bandiera-Moro, was made up
of the patrician youth of Venice, who, with their
ancient love of splendor, wore velvet tunics, gray
scarves, and caps with plumes. When the bitter
fight came at Fort Malghera they held their guns
heroically, fresh men leaping to replace the dead,
cheering for Venice as the bombs fell among them,
firing and eating and carrying off the wounded
under a devastating fusillade. Venice thirsted for
glory, and she won it; there are no more stirring
tales in history than that of the brief defense of
the new-born Republic.</p>

<p>In July came continual bombardment, and
with it cholera, and the seeds of sedition spread
by Austrian spies. Manin feared civil dissension,
he heard grumblers in the streets. No one dared
accuse the man, whom the Assembly had chosen
absolute dictator, of any wavering or treasonable
thought, but some raised cries beneath his win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>dows
in the Piazzetta. The Dictator appeared
suddenly before them. &ldquo;Venetians,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is
this worthy of you? You are not the people,
you are only an insignificant faction. Never will
I accede to the caprices of a mob! My acts shall
be guided solely by the representatives of the
people, assembled in their Congress. I will always
speak the truth to you, even should muskets
be leveled at my breast, and daggers be pointed
at my heart. And now go home, all of you&mdash;go
home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words swayed even that rebellious crowd,
and they cheered him. For the time sedition was
silent, but the people were losing hope. They were
a mere handful battling with the forces of an empire.
Manin saw that all he could do was to insure
that his people died as heroes.</p>

<p>The city was the prey of famine, pestilence, and
fire when on August 13 she held her last <i>festa</i>.
The Dictator spoke to the troops in the Square
of St. Mark&rsquo;s. His words rang like a clarion
call. &ldquo;A people that have done and suffered as
our people have done and suffered cannot die.
The day shall come when a splendid destiny will be
your guerdon. What time will bring that day?
This rests with God. We have sown the good
seed: it will take root in good soil.... If it
be not ours to ward off these calamities, it is ours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to maintain inviolate the honor of the city....
One single day that sees Venice not worthy of herself,
and all that she has done will be lost and
forgotten.&rdquo; He asked them if they had still their
confidence in him, if not he would resign the leadership
to another. The Square shook with the thunder
of the soldiers&rsquo; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; He went on: &ldquo;Your
indomitable love saddens me, and makes me feel
yet more how this people suffer! On my mental
and bodily faculties you must not count, but count
always on my great, tender, undying affection.
And come what may, say, &lsquo;This man was misled:&rsquo;
but do not ever say, &lsquo;This man misled us.&rsquo; I have
deceived no one. I have never spread illusions
which were not my own. I have never said I
hoped when I had no hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he finished speaking he staggered, and was
barely able to get to the Council Chamber. There
his physical weakness overmastered him. &ldquo;Such
a people,&rdquo; he cried brokenly, &ldquo;for such a people
to be obliged to surrender!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless each hour now brought home the
conviction that the strength of Venice was ebbing
rapidly. Flames and the plague and the unremitting
Austrian attack were bringing the proud city
to her knees. Manin could only hope that he
might at the last make honorable terms of surrender,
he would not sacrifice all their heroic ef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>forts
to the desire for instant peace. On August
18 the people gathered in St. Mark&rsquo;s Square, begging
for some word of their President&rsquo;s plans.
He came out before them. &ldquo;Venetians,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I have already told you frankly that our situation
is a grave one, but if it be grave it is not
desperate to the degree of reducing us to cowardice
... it is an infamy to suppose that Venice would
ask of me to do what was infamous; and if she
should ask it this one sacrifice I would not make&mdash;even
for Venice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one in the throng cried, &ldquo;We are hungry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him who is hungry stand forth!&rdquo; answered
Manin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of us,&rdquo; cried the devoted people. &ldquo;We
are Italians! Long live Manin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Five days later the city was torn by conflicting
rumors of mutiny and surrender. Manin had
not yet succeeded in winning the terms he wanted
from the Austrians. When the people called for
him he came out on the balcony as he had so often
done before. He spoke a few words, and then a
sudden pain seized him and he fell fainting into a
chair. A little later he reappeared and cried to
the cheering people, &ldquo;Let those who are true Venetians
patrol the city to-night with me.&rdquo; Then he
took his sword, and at the head of a great concourse,
marched to the section of the city where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the mutineers had gathered. Shots were fired.
Manin stepped forward. &ldquo;If you wish my life,
take it!&rdquo; he said. The mutineers were silenced.</p>

<p>The following day, August 24, 1849, the city
capitulated, the stock of provisions having been
absolutely exhausted that same day. The terms
were honorable, such Venetian soldiers as had been
in the Austrian service were to leave Venice. Forty
civilians, headed by Manin, were to leave. The
powers of government were temporarily lodged in
the municipality.</p>

<p>That same day Manin left the Doge&rsquo;s Palace for
his own small house. All day the people passed
before the door, saying, &ldquo;Here lives our poor
father! How much he has suffered for us!&rdquo; He
was too absolutely worn out to see any one. At
midnight he with his wife and son and invalid small
daughter went on board the French steamer
<i>Pluton</i>. All but one of them were taking their
last farewell of Venice.</p>

<p>The municipality, knowing that their great
leader was penniless, had gathered a small sum of
money and forced him to accept it before he left.
He felt that the other exiles were in as great
need of it as he, and so quietly distributed it
among them through friends on the various ships
that were bearing the exiles away. He had
thought of the people as his children for so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a time that he had still to take the care of them
upon himself.</p>

<p>The little family of four felt that it was farewell
as they watched the palaces and churches,
towers and pillars of the City of the Lagunes
drop beneath the horizon. The view of Venice
from the sea, incomparably beautiful, must have
been unspeakably sad to Manin&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Marseilles the devoted wife
fell ill of cholera, and, worn out with the long
siege, was powerless to resist. She had written
on leaving Venice, &ldquo;All is over, all is lost save
honor! I am going to a foreign land, where I
shall hear a language not my own. My beautiful
language, I shall never hear it again; never more!&rdquo;
She died soon after reaching Marseilles.</p>

<p>Manin took his two children with him to Paris,
and gave himself up to nursing the little girl, who
was the victim of a continual nervous disorder.
The daughter and father were united by a bond of
love that was wonderfully strong and spiritual,
they seemed to understand each other always without
words. He kept a little note-book record of
her illness as an aid to the physicians, and after
his death the book was found with the touching
inscription on the cover, &ldquo;Alla mia Santa Martire.&rdquo;
Her desire to comfort her father sustained
her for some years, she knew that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
become to him in a spiritual manner the living image
of his unhappy country. She struggled with
all the heroism of a remarkable character to hide
her sufferings from him even as he sought to hide
from her the anguish her illness caused him.
Daniel and Emilia Manin were worthy to be
father and daughter, both were heroic souls. In
1854 Emilia died, her last words, &ldquo;My darling
Venice, I shall never see you again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manin and his son stayed on in the French
capital, the father giving lessons in Italian for
support. He had harbored no resentment against
France for her failure to come to the aid of Venice,
he felt that the French people were near kin
to his own. He welcomed all Italians or sympathizers
with Italy, he predicted that eventually the
entire peninsula would be one in freedom. He met
Cavour in Paris and talked long about Venice with
him, he was gradually becoming convinced that
Piedmont could and would lead the other states
to victory. His study was hung with portraits
of the most dissimilar characters, all one in interest
for his country, Charles Albert opposite to Mazzini,
Garibaldi opposite Gioberti, Montanelli near
D&rsquo;Azeglio. He wrote articles on Italy for the
papers and traveled in England to arouse British
interest in his cause. It was a great day when
he saw the Italian tri-color flying beside the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and English flags to show that Piedmont had
joined the allies in the Crimean war. &ldquo;In serving
under the tri-colored flag of Italian redemption,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;the soldiers who fight in the Crimea
are not the soldiers of the Piedmontese province,
but the soldiers of Italy.&rdquo; He understood the
boldness of Cavour&rsquo;s great diplomatic stroke and
gave Piedmont the credit she deserved in becoming
the first envoy of a great nation.</p>

<p>While his strength lasted Manin worked in the
cause, but finally he was overcome by physical sufferings.
He wrote in June, 1857, to his friend the
Marquis Pallavicino, &ldquo;A month&rsquo;s rest in the country
has not calmed the fever of my poor brain.
All work, all meditation, is utterly impossible to
me. Not only cannot I think about serious things,
but I am not able to give my mind to the most
unimportant matters. This will explain my silence.
I lose patience and hope. My painful and
useless life becomes intolerable. I ardently desire
the end. Farewell.&rdquo; The physical weariness with
which he had battled all his life was at last overpowering
him. He still believed that his principles
would ultimately conquer, but knew that he
should not see Venice freed. September 22, 1857,
he died, at the age of fifty-three years.</p>

<p>August 30, 1849, Radetzky and the Austrians
had entered Venice, replaced the Lion banner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
St. Mark with the yellow and black flag of Austria,
and had expected to see the pleasure-loving
city sink back into its former quiescent indolence.
What they expected did not come to pass. Instead
for seventeen years Venice mourned its lost liberty
and lived only in the thought of that day when
it should rise again and finally. There was no
shame in this subjection, no happy compromise.
This was Manin&rsquo;s achievement, he had made his
people worthy to be free. That was the purpose
of his heroic struggle, the lesson of his life.</p>

<p>July 5, 1866, the yellow and black flag of
Austria fell from the <i>pili</i>, and October 18 of that
same year the red, white, and green flag of united
Italy greeted a free Venice. There was one wish
in the people&rsquo;s heart, that only their &ldquo;dear father
Manin&rdquo; might have lived to see that glorious day.</p>

<p>The remains of Manin, his wife and daughter,
lie now close to the Church of St. Mark, his statue
looks down upon the people in the square before
his house even as he so often stood on the
Palace balcony to speak to them in the days of
1849. All through Venice there are reminders
of him, and he has taken his place among the
great heroes of that historic city&mdash;himself her
greatest hero, her sincerest patriot. The simple
advocate, the great President, the &ldquo;dear father&rdquo;
of the Venetian people.</p>

<h2><a name="MAZZINI_THE_PROPHET" id="MAZZINI_THE_PROPHET">MAZZINI, THE PROPHET</a></h2>


<p class="start-chap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> men become legendary during their own
lives. Their personalities have a certain detachment
from the rest of the world so that common
standards have no value as applied to them.
They are poets or seers or philosophers, and often
their mystic quality is of little use to the great
mass of men, and is only to be appreciated by the
few. Sometimes the whole world understands them.
Mazzini had become a legend to the people of
Europe long before his death, but a legend that
carried the strongest personal appeal to every
republican heart. You have only to dip into letters
of the time to realize how close he came to
millions of thinkers throughout Europe.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to consider the force of
popular legend in a national movement, to weigh
sentiment against statesmanship and military
prowess. The land of Dante and of Savonarola
would be an especially fertile field for such inquiry,
among no people has the prophet been held
of higher value than with the Italians. To-day
we find them turning to their dramatists and novelists
for help in the solution of new social prob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>lems
just as Mazzini and the youth of his day
looked to Alfieri for political guidance. There is
no doubt that Mazzini believed it was his destiny
to be a poet, and that throughout his whole life
he looked forward to the day when Italy should be
united and free, and he could turn to the work of
writing her dramas.</p>

<p>Literary feuds play so little part in Anglo-Saxon
history that we find it difficult to understand
the importance of their place in Latin countries.
Italy a century ago was the battle-ground of the
Romanticists and Classicists. The Classicists believed
in a certain smug cloistered virtue, a policy
of non-resistance, and the contemplation of past
glories. It was the ambition of the Romanticists
&ldquo;to give Italians an original national literature,
not one that is as a sound of passing music to
tickle the ear and die, but one that will interpret
to them their aspirations, their ideas, their needs,
their social movement.&rdquo; Alfieri had been preaching
resistance to Austrian tyranny through his
dramas, the boy Mazzini first looked to him as a
political saviour of Italy. He wrote, &ldquo;these literary
disputes are bound up with all that is important
in social and civil life,&rdquo; and again &ldquo;the
legislation and literature of a people always advance
on parallel lines.&rdquo; &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; first
hoped to win freedom through its literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The ill-fated Carbonari rebellion of 1821 sent
many Piedmontese patriots flying through Genoa
to Spain. Giuseppe Mazzini, then sixteen years of
age, walking from church one Sunday morning in
Genoa in company with his mother, was stopped
by a tall, gaunt-featured, black-eyed man who
held out his hat asking alms for &ldquo;the refugees
of Italy.&rdquo; The scene made a tremendous impression
on the youth&rsquo;s mind, for the first time he felt
that the cause of freedom was not a scholastic
subject, but one demanding the height of sacrifice.
He set himself to study the causes of the
failure of past uprisings, and at the same time
dedicated himself to the work of teaching his countrymen
how they might succeed.</p>

<p>The French Revolution had failed because it
had taught men only a knowledge of their rights,
without any conception of their duties. Men had
not learned the law of self-restraint, and their ideal
was the greatest personal liberty rather than the
greatest personal obligation to their fellow-men.
The revolutionists of Europe had a philosophy, but
no religion. The first great discovery that Mazzini
made was that if Italy were ever to be united,
his countrymen must be fired with faith in their
own God-given destinies. They must make of their
cause a religion, they must learn, in his words,
that Italy &ldquo;had a strength within her, that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
arbiter of facts, mightier than destiny itself.&rdquo; At
the start he offered his countrymen two arguments
for action, the one that this land of theirs had
twice ruled the world, that she who had given Christianity
and the Renaissance to Europe had yet
to send forth &ldquo;the gospel of humanity.&rdquo; He
wrote: &ldquo;Italy has been called a graveyard; but
a graveyard peopled by our mighty dead is nearer
life than a land that teems with living weaklings
and braggarts;&rdquo; he showed Italians &ldquo;the vision
of their country, radiant, purified by suffering,
moving as an angel of light among the nations
that thought her dead.&rdquo; Such words rang like
an inspiration, but Mazzini, studying the men with
whom he had to work, knew that such inspiration
was not enough. They struck the note of
glory, but all revolutionists had heard that note;
what was needed was the call to self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>With this fundamental need firmly fixed in his
mind Mazzini gave what spare hours fell to the
lot of a young Italian lawyer to the work of
writing to the independent journals. At first he
leaned to the side of caution, realizing how strict
was the censorship of the Italian press, but gradually
he contrived to slip bolder and more inflammatory
messages into circulation under the censor&rsquo;s
nose. He spoke of a new party that should arise in
a short time, and called it &ldquo;Young Italy,&rdquo; he ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>pressed
deep sympathy with political exiles, he
turned his literary criticisms into studies of national
development. Ultimately one of the papers
for which he wrote, the &ldquo;Indicatore Livornese,&rdquo;
became too daring, and was ended by the authorities.
Mazzini then aimed higher, and gained
credit with the &ldquo;Antologia,&rdquo; the Edinburgh Review
of Italy, by a series of articles on the historical
drama.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was still studying the problem of
giving a new religion to the youth of Italy. He
had joined the Society of the Carbonari, and was
learning that the plots and counter-plots of an unwieldy
secret society would accomplish no good
end. There was too much ritual, too little effort.
The Carbonari had no definite plan, they were entirely
at the mercy of any chance leader of disaffection,
each member only knew one or two other
members. Of a sudden the Revolution of July in
France fired liberals throughout Europe, Mazzini
and his young friends in Genoa immediately began
active preparations for a military uprising.
Lead was being cast into bullets when the police
of Genoa intervened and Mazzini was placed under
arrest. He had been suspected of revolutionary
sentiments for some time. The Governor of Genoa
told Giuseppe&rsquo;s father that he considered the son
&ldquo;was gifted with some talent, and too fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
walking by himself at night absorbed in thought.
What on earth has he at his age to think about?
We don&rsquo;t like young people thinking without our
knowing the subject of their thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mazzini was taken to the fortress of Savona,
and there imprisoned to await his trial. The
commander of the fortress allowed the young
prisoner to keep his Bible, Tacitus, and Byron.
From these hours of solitary confinement sprang
the youth&rsquo;s passionate regard for the English poet,
a man whose writings he later vehemently held
were only to be classed with Dante as an inspiration
to Italians.</p>

<p>The government could prove nothing definite
against him, but he was thought too dangerous a
man to be at large, and so was finally given his
choice between nominal imprisonment in a small
town and exile. France was throbbing with a new
democracy, Paris was the center of revolutionary
propaganda, and so Mazzini chose exile there.
Early in 1831 he parted from his family at Savona
and started north. He felt that he had come
to the parting of the ways, and that henceforth
his life was to be absolutely given to the cause.
For the first time he saw the Alps, and his nature,
always strongly susceptible to heroic scenery, was
deeply stirred. He watched the sunrise from
Mont Cenis and wrote, &ldquo;The first ray of light trem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>bling
on the horizon, vague and pale, like a
timid, uncertain hope, then the long line of fire
cutting the blue heaven, firm and decided as a
promise;&rdquo; here was the poet soul free at last to
speak its message.</p>

<p>With the date of this first exile begins Mazzini&rsquo;s
call to &ldquo;Young Italy.&rdquo; He had recognized
that his countrymen must waken to a new
religion, that their souls must be touched rather
than their ambitions. The youth of Italy would
feel the call more strongly than the middle-aged.
&ldquo;Place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the young at the head of the
insurgent masses; you do not know what strength
is latent in those young bands, what magic influence
the voice of the young has on the crowd; you
will find in them a host of apostles for the new religion.
But youth lives on movement, grows great
in enthusiasm and faith. Consecrate them with a
lofty mission, inflame them with emulation and
praise; spread through their ranks the word of
fire, the word of inspiration; speak to them of
country, of glory, of power, of great memories.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All great national movements,&rdquo; he wrote later,
&ldquo;begin with the unknown men of the people, without
influence except for the faith and will that
counts not time or difficulties.&rdquo; Mazzini was not
diffident with regard to his own youthful powers,
nor was Cavour, five years Mazzini&rsquo;s junior, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
wrote to a friend at this time prophesying that he
would one morning wake up Prime Minister of
Italy.</p>

<p>The most important feature of &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo;
was its religion, the Carbonari had had none. Men
were now told that they had a mission given them
by God, and that what had been before a mere
personal right had become a sacred duty. The
second feature was the liberation of the poor, a
need which all former revolutionists had seemed to
overlook. The French Revolution had had no such
substructure, the poets and dramatists had idealized
national rather than social liberty, but Mazzini
saw that the time had come for a further step,
that Austria was not the only enemy his people
had to fear. He wrote, &ldquo;I see the people pass before
my eyes in the livery of wretchedness and political
subjection, ragged and hungry, painfully
gathering the crumbs that wealth tosses insultingly
to it, or lost and wandering in riot and the
intoxication of a brutish, angry, savage joy; and
I remember that these brutalized faces bear the
finger-print of God, the mark of the same mission
as my own. I lift myself to the vision of the future
and behold the people rising in its majesty,
brothers in one faith, one bond of equality and
love, one ideal of citizen virtue that ever grows in
beauty and might; the people of the future, un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>spoilt
by luxury, ungoaded by wretchedness, awed
by the consciousness of its rights and duties, and
in the presence of that vision my heart beats with
anguish for the present and glorying for the future.&rdquo;
Mazzini gave &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; as its
watchword &ldquo;God and the People.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There can be no question but that &ldquo;Young
Italy&rdquo; was strong where the Carbonari had been
weak, but both movements had of necessity many
of the same defects. Government espionage forced
the new movement like its predecessors to choose
the devious courses of a secret society. The restlessness
of the age caused the new movement to
take each fitful start as a momentous signal. The
strength of Austria was not underestimated, but
the weakness of the disunited Italian states was.
Diplomacy was disregarded; it was only many
years later that Mazzini the prophet learned the
value of Cavour the statesman. &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo;
was launched in a troublous sea, destined to encounter
many storms, but fated ultimately to
spread abroad the seeds of the hope that was to
awaken republicans throughout all European
countries.</p>

<p>Mazzini no sooner arrived in Lyons than he
found himself in the center of plots. The French
government, still fresh from the days of July, was
in two minds; first they aided a band of Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
refugees who were planning a raid into Savoy,
then they faced about and scattered the conspirators.
Another plan was for a trip to Corsica,
there to gather arms to aid the insurgents in
Romagna, but the funds for this attempt were
lacking. Mazzini gave up immediate action for
the moment, and locating at Marseilles started
with a few youthful friends to organize his great
concerted movement. They had nothing but
youth and audacity. A contemporary (probably
Enrico Mayer) described Mazzini at this time as
&ldquo;about 5 feet 8 inches high, and slightly made;
he was dressed in black Genoa velvet, with a large
&lsquo;republican&rsquo; hat; his long, curling black hair,
which fell upon his shoulders, the extreme freshness
of his clear olive complexion, the chiseled delicacy
of his regular and beautiful features, aided by his
very youthful look and sweetness and openness of
expression, would have made his appearance almost
too feminine, if it had not been for his noble
forehead, the power of firmness and decision that
was mingled with their gaiety and sweetness in
the bright flashes of his dark eyes and in the
varying expression of his mouth, together with
his small and beautiful mustachios and beard.
Altogether he was at that time the most beautiful
being, male or female, that I had ever seen, and
I have not since seen his equal.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Mazzini was proud of these early days when he
looked back upon them later. He wrote, &ldquo;We had
no office, no helpers. All day, and a great part of
the night, we were buried in our work, writing articles
and letters, getting information from travelers,
enlisting seamen, folding papers, fastening
envelopes, dividing our time between literary
and manual work. La Cecilia was compositor;
Lamberti corrected the proofs; another of us
made himself literally porter, to save the expense
of distributing papers. We lived as equals and
brothers; we had but one thought, one hope,
one ideal to reverence. The foreign republicans
loved and admired us for our tenacity and unflagging
industry; we were often in real want,
but we were light-hearted in a way, and smiling
because we believed in the future.&rdquo; It was Mazzini&rsquo;s
period of boundless hope.</p>

<p>Much of this hope throbbed through the literature
that the small Marseilles press scattered
throughout Europe, men were in such a state of
unrest that the burning words became to them a
prophetic writing on the wall. In a hundred ways
the contraband pamphlets were smuggled across
frontiers, all classes sent assurances of support
and aid to the young men in Marseilles, everywhere
lodges of &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; were started,
and local editors scattered Mazzini&rsquo;s doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
through their immediate territories. Priests, attracted
by the strong religious tenor, professional
and business men, many of the nobility even joined
the new movement. Garibaldi, a young officer in
the Genoese merchant service, Gioberti, then a
teacher at Vercelli, Ruffini, and his fellow-conspirators
working under the very shadow of destruction
at Genoa, enrolled under the new standard
of &ldquo;God and the People.&rdquo; The old members
of the Carbonari, the followers of Buonarotti and
his &ldquo;veri Italiani&rdquo; joined the ranks, within two
years &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; counted its members by the
tens of thousands. Not since the era of the great
Crusades had there been any simultaneous rising
to compare with it.</p>

<p>All men who hoped for the coming of a united
Italy looked towards Piedmont as the state by
which the first step must be taken. Piedmont had
great military traditions. It supported an efficient
army, it was so situated that it held the key
of entrance into Lombardy, and had the Alps and
the Apennines as a base of retreat. In Piedmont
there was moreover an intense national feeling,
the House of Savoy was deeply rooted in the affections
of the people, and almost alone among the
Italian sovereignties that House was practically
indigenous to the soil. In Charles Albert Piedmont
had just received a king who was an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>tense
nationalist, to whom the name of &ldquo;Italia&rdquo;
was sacred, and who, at certain times, seems to
have felt that he was destined to drive the foreigner
beyond the Alps. He was no liberal, both
his nature and his priestly advisers counseled him
against revolutionary measures, he had not the
sanguine temper of the leader, he was more the
theorist than the actor. Yet with all his temperamental
defects the men of the new generation
looked on him as a possible saviour, he had
given countenance to the Carbonari in his youth,
and had led the conspirators of 1821 to believe
that he would side with them in any war for Lombard
independence. He had not given such aid as
they expected, but he was still the one sovereign to
whom &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; could look with any measure
of hope. Mazzini was never an ardent believer
in monarchies, but now, when his new party was
growing with tremendous leaps and bounds, he felt
that even the leadership of a king was better than
no leadership at all. He was ready at this time to
sacrifice republicanism for nationalism; how far
he would then have followed a monarchy, if successful,
is a difficult question to decide. He was so
much in earnest that he could not always critically
balance the means and the end.</p>

<p>Early in 1831 Mazzini published his famous
letter to Charles Albert. It was the cry of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
prophet to a later generation. He pointed out
that the King of Piedmont needed no aid from
Austria or France. &ldquo;There is a crown more brilliant
and sublime than that of Piedmont, a crown
that waits the man who dares to think of it, who
dedicates his life to winning it, and scorns to dull
the splendor with thoughts of petty tyranny.
Sire, have you ever cast an eagle glance upon this
Italy, so fair with nature&rsquo;s smile, crowned by
twenty centuries of noble memory, the land of
genius, strong in the infinite resources that only
want a common purpose, girt round with barriers
so impregnable, that it needs but a firm will and
a few brave breasts to shelter it from foreign insult?
Place yourself at the head of the nation,
write on your flag, &lsquo;Union, Liberty, Independence.&rsquo;
Free Italy from the barbarian, build up the future,
be the Napoleon of Italian freedom. Do this
and we will gather round you, we will give our
lives for you, we will bring the little states of Italy
under your flag. Your safety lies on the sword&rsquo;s
point, draw it and throw away the scabbard. But
remember, if you do it not, others will do it without
you and against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charles Albert had moments of heroism, but
they were only too often followed by moments of
overwhelming caution. If he ever read Mazzini&rsquo;s
letter he must have thrilled at the call to save a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
country he loved with the whole ardor of his nature.
After that first thrill had passed he must
have realized that the time to take such a supreme
step had not come, or that he had not the will to
lead it. Once harboring such a doubt the King became
a battle-ground for advisers, and when the
short fight for control of the King&rsquo;s mind was won,
the reactionaries proved themselves the victors.
The unfortunate King allowed others to act
against his better judgment; when the fire of revolt
next blazed up in Piedmont the government
turned a savage face towards the conspirators.
The little band of revolutionists was hounded without
mercy, terror reigned in Genoa, and the only
choice offered the rebels was between betrayal of
their friends and execution. Jacopo Ruffini, one
of Mazzini&rsquo;s dearest boyhood friends, killed himself
in prison when offered such an alternative.
The pendulum swung back, gaining momentum
thereby for its coming flight. &ldquo;Ideas,&rdquo; wrote
Mazzini, &ldquo;ripen quickly when nourished by the
blood of martyrs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At twenty-eight Mazzini found himself an outcast,
hunted at last from France as he had been
before from Italy, living in the closest concealment
in Switzerland, all his hopes tumbling about
him. He tried to organize a band of raiders who
should enter Savoy from the Swiss frontier; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
were disrupted by treachery and distrust before
the first shot was fired. Mazzini&rsquo;s health broke
under the endless strain, there were nights when
he never went to bed, days when he had to lie concealed
in a goatherd&rsquo;s hut. At times he seemed
to find his only consolation in the white-capped
mountains, them he passionately worshiped,
the Alps were always nearest to him after
Italy. He had very few friends, almost no books;
there were no presses now to speak his words to
the young hearts of Europe, only occasionally
word came to him that his great idea was growing
in the outer world.</p>

<p>In those dark days in Switzerland Mazzini suffered
most from the thought that he had entailed
all his family and friends in his vain sacrifice.
His boyhood confidants were dead or in exile, families
he loved were scattered over many countries,
the few women he knew well were left solitary in
their homes. The woman he loved he felt he could
not ask to marry him, he had no home to give her,
and scarcely knew whether his next day&rsquo;s food
would be forthcoming. He wrote to a friend, &ldquo;I
wanted to do good, but I have always done harm
to everybody, and the thought grows and grows
until I think I shall go mad. Sometimes I fancy
I am hated by those I love most.&rdquo; In all his letters
of this period we catch the note of a spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
torn between pity for sufferings he thinks himself
to have caused, and the stern sense of a duty
given him by God. They are wonderful letters,
the thoughts of a man who could put no limits to
his own self-sacrifice nor value too highly the sacrifices
of others. In one letter he wrote: &ldquo;I think
over it from morning to night, and ask pardon of
my God for having been a conspirator; not that
I in the least repent the reasons for it, or recant
a single one of my beliefs, which were and are and
will be a religion to me, but because I ought to
have seen that there are times when a believer
should only sacrifice himself to his belief. I have
sacrificed everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great heroic spirit was trying to justify, not
its own aims, but the sorrows it had brought upon
others. Mazzini could never have seemed hard
and cold, but in those dark days in Switzerland,
and in those later to come in London, the gentle,
humble spirit of him was pre-eminent. He loved
friendship, home life, the arts; he had met his
ideal woman; and yet each and every joy life had
to offer him he gave up on the altar of his duty.
&ldquo;Duty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an arid, bare religion, which
does not save my heart a single atom of unhappiness,
but still the only one that can save me from
suicide;&rdquo; and again he wrote, &ldquo;When a man has
once said to himself in all seriousness of thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and feeling, I believe in liberty and country and
humanity, he is bound to fight for liberty and
country and humanity&mdash;fight while life lasts,
fight always, fight with every weapon, face all
from death to ridicule, face hatred and contempt,
work on because it is his duty, and for no other
reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1837 Mazzini gave up the heights of
Switzerland for the fogs of London, moved largely
to this change by the fact that in England he
need no longer live in hiding. He did not look forward
with any eagerness to life in England; if the
English cared little what political beliefs refugees
brought with them, they were not the people to
flame with interest in a cause. Byron, Mazzini
considered more Italian than English; he could not
conceive of poetry as stirring the British blood.
He took cheap lodgings, and set himself to writing
for support, finding time to keep up his correspondence
with members of &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo;
scattered over Europe, and also time to look after
such Italians in London as were in greater
straits than he. The Ruffini family were with
him for a time, then misunderstandings separated
them, and the last tie that bound him to Genoa was
gone. He lived the pathetic life of a literary
hack, spending his days working in the British
Museum, and his nights writing in his own small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
room. The one charm he found about London was
its fog. &ldquo;The whole city,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;seems under
a kind of spell, and reminds me of the witches&rsquo;
scene in Macbeth or the Brocksberg or the Witch
of Endor. The passers-by look like ghosts&mdash;one
feels almost a ghost oneself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lack of money oppressed him sorely; he
would give to every Italian who begged of him on
the score of universal brotherhood, gradually his
few possessions went their way to the pawnshop.
He said that he needed only a place to write and a
few pennies to buy cigars. Then by one of those
curious chances of fate he met the Carlyles, and
his life became a little less cramped and lonely, although
perhaps more tempestuous. There are a
score of accounts of evenings Mazzini spent with
these new friends, the one of whom he admired as
a great thinker, the other as a truly noble woman.
In time Carlyle tried the gentle Italian sorely;
the story goes that the philosopher would rage at
all human institutions with the violence of a hurricane
and then turn to his guest with the words,
&ldquo;You have not succeeded yet because you have
talked too much.&rdquo; We can picture the boisterous,
stormy Englishman thundering at those ideals
which the sensitive, passionate Italian was trying
to defend. It speaks well for Mazzini that he
said of Carlyle, &ldquo;He is good, good, good; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
still, I think in spite of his great reputation, unhappy.&rdquo;
Carlyle&rsquo;s estimate of Mazzini was that
he was &ldquo;by nature a little lyrical poet.&rdquo; This opposition
of ideas did not, however, keep him from
defending his Italian friend when others attacked
him. The London <i>Times</i> saw fit to speak slightingly
of Mazzini, and Carlyle wrote the editors in
noble indignation. &ldquo;Whatever I may think of his
practical insight and skill in worldly affairs,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I can with great freedom testify to all men
that he, if I have ever seen such, is a man of
genius and virtue, a man of sterling veracity, humanity,
and nobleness of mind, one of those rare
men, numerable, unfortunately, but as units in this
world, who are worthy to be called martyr souls;
who in silence, piously in their daily life, understand
and practise what is meant by that.&rdquo; These
were glowing words, and thrilled Mazzini as he
read them. They were a tribute to Carlyle&rsquo;s justice,
but it is doubtful if he ever really understood
the Italian. He would have found it difficult to
discover a prophet living in lodgings so near to
his own house.</p>

<p>Gradually Mazzini made other English friends,
and he worked his way into the pages of the best
reviews. In time also his political efforts were revived;
he never let any temporary interest dim his
goal. He started a society of Italian workmen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
London, and edited a paper for them, and opened
an evening school where poor Italian boys were
taught to read and write and learn something of
Italian history. This school was very near his
heart, he was always devoted to children.</p>

<p>During Mazzini&rsquo;s exiled years in London,
&ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; had spread over Europe, and
through countless secret channels was gradually
making its strength felt. Outside circumstances
were needed to bring its forces to a head, but
there was no doubt that Mazzini&rsquo;s words had called
a power into being that must in time inevitably
come to a life and death struggle with the Austrians.
It is difficult to point out the exact minor
causes of each fluctuation in Italian opinion, it is
certain that the new popular literature called
readers to take account of the words of Dante,
and that the more they read the great poet the
more they longed for liberty from the foreigner.
Charles Albert, it was felt, was again dreaming
of heroic measures, and something of the old, almost
legendary faith in the house of Savoy as a
national deliverer, re-awakened. Manzoni and
Gioberti were prophesying a great Catholic revival,
and the election of Pius the Ninth seemed
for the moment to justify the hope. The half-pitiful
words of Pius, &ldquo;They want to make a Napoleon
of me who am only a poor country parson,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was a more correct estimate of the Pontiff than
the glowing words of his contemporaries; he was
no more in accord with the spirit of his time than
was Metternich. Still his election marked the
swing of the pendulum in the liberal direction, and
&ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; was quick to take notice of such a
fact.</p>

<p>The year 1848 was remarkable for concerted
social movements throughout Europe. In France
the Second Republic overthrew the monarchy, and
throughout the Italian states an electric current
shocked the people into revolution. Leghorn revolted
and made Guerrazzi its chief, Milan fell
easy victim to the Tobacco rioters, Sicily sent its
Bourbon king flying, and Naples wrested a popular
constitution from the greedy hand of Ferdinand.
Piedmont and Tuscany followed soon, demanded
and obtained constitutions, and the
Pope, alarmed at the sudden spread of liberalism,
granted a constitution to Rome. The moment
seemed ripe to throw off the Austrian overlords.</p>

<p>There are few more tangled histories than the
record of the next few months in Italy. It is a
drama filled with heroic figures, but one through
which runs the current of continual misunderstandings.
Was Italy to be a kingdom or a republic?
Was the Pope a menace or a help? Was
French aid to be courted or rejected? These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
were only a few of the questions on which men
split. The one glorious fact was the burning
patriotic ardor of Italians in each state from
Sicily to Savoy, their actual belief in the religion
of duty Mazzini had been preaching to
them.</p>

<p>Word came to Milan that there was revolution
in Vienna, and the Five Days drove the Austrian
garrison from their stronghold. Como, Brescia,
Venice, all the northern cities that had so long
loathed the white-coated overlords, won freedom;
Metternich&rsquo;s puppet-princes of Modena and
Parma fled. Piedmont declared war, Tuscany declared
war, volunteers of all ranks and ages
poured from Umbria to help the northern armies.
Mazzini, hearing the news in London, sped to
Milan, and was received as the prophet of the
new day. Italy had its prophet, but the statesman
and the soldier were not yet recognized.</p>

<p>The new provisional government in Milan had
no fixed policy, Charles Albert&rsquo;s advisers still
clogged his steps, the volunteers were ready, but
they had neither the arms nor the training to
compete with the war-worn Austrians. While
there was discussion and dissension in Lombardy,
the enemy recuperated and returned to besiege the
cities they had lost. By July the Italian army
was driven into Milan, there the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
earlier Five Days revived, but victory appeared
hopeless, and finally Charles Albert, torn and distracted,
surrendered the city. Mazzini passed to
Lugano, thence to Leghorn, thence to Florence; in
each city the situation was practically the same,
the people were aflame with devotion to Italy,
the leaders had as many plans as there were
men.</p>

<p>Rome had driven out the Pope and proclaimed
the Republic. The call of Rome was the call direct
to Mazzini&rsquo;s soul, he turned there to find a
solution of all difficulties. Simultaneously the
newly formed Roman Assembly turned to him,
and bade him welcome as a citizen of Rome. He
believed that Dante&rsquo;s vision and his own were
coming true, and hurried to the Eternal City.
His first work there was to raise ten thousand
troops and send them north. They had scarcely
started when the crushing news of the defeat at
Novara stunned all patriots. Rome had to look
to herself, and made Mazzini Triumvir and practically
dictator of the city.</p>

<p>The little Roman Republic of 1849 had an inspiring
history. Mazzini had written and spoken,
now it became his turn to act. He was set at the
head of a city from which its spiritual as well as
its temporal head had fled. Priests and protesting
laymen were all about him, it would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
easy for him to scorn the power that scoffed at
him. He did not, he himself doubted the strength
of the Catholic Church to survive, he dreamed of
a new church which should speak to the world
from the seven hills of Rome, but he would not
take a single step to destroy one man&rsquo;s religion.
More than that he made it his special duty to see
that the priests were not disturbed in their work.
He wanted the Republic to be based on the love of
God. He hoped that the Church would aid the
Italian cause for the love of man. He would
allow the Pope to reign as spiritual Prince,
if he would only be content with his own noble
sphere.</p>

<p>Rome won back something of its historic ardor
under Mazzini&rsquo;s call. The Republic was planned
on lines of great proportions, steps were actually
taken to make it a republic wherein each man had
a worthy share. The foundations were laid with
the greatest patience and zeal, the Triumvir gave
the last ounce of his strength to building truly,
he lived as he had always lived, for others, and
took nothing for himself. Margaret Fuller said
that at this time his face, haggard and worn,
seemed to her &ldquo;more divine than ever.&rdquo; The
poorest citizen could find him as readily as the
richest, he was the same to all, he gave away his
small salary of office as entirely as in his London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
days he had dispersed his earnings. If ever man&rsquo;s
rule was noble, if ever it was spiritual, that of
Rome&rsquo;s Triumvir was, in the weeks when he faced
treachery both from without and within.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible that Mazzini could have
expected his city to stand against the armies that
were marching towards it. At most he could only
hope to show the Romans of what great self-sacrifice
they were capable. He probably hoped that
the Republic would convince Italians that the
spirit of &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; was not a mere
prophet&rsquo;s dream. That he did; he could not fight
Austria and France single-handed.</p>

<p>Louis Napoleon had evolved one of his great
ideas, he would win both the French army and the
French clergy by a strategic move. He sent
Oudinot into Italy, blinding the Romans with
various subtleties, waiting until the propitious
hour to strike. The Romans understood, the Assembly
voted to resist to the end, and Garibaldi
led the troops to their first victory. De Lesseps
was appointed peace negotiator for the French,
and he and Mazzini met, and for a time it
seemed as though there might be a reconciliation.
Mazzini strove with the greatest tact and patience
to win the French, but De Lesseps was
nothing more than Napoleon&rsquo;s dupe, and as soon
as Garibaldi had advanced to meet the Neapolitan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
king&rsquo;s army, Napoleon removed his envoy and
showed his hand.</p>

<p>The truce had been virtually agreed on when
Oudinot suddenly attacked and placed Rome in
a state of siege. For almost a month the citizens
fought with unfailing courage. Mazzini,
Garibaldi, Mameli, the martyr war-poet, Bassi,
the great preacher, republicans and royalists,
princes and peasants, all within Rome&rsquo;s walls
fought for freedom from the foreigner. There
could be but one end, and it came when starvation
and losses had weakened the defenders so that
they could no longer hold their posts. Mazzini
would have fought hand-to-hand in the streets,
the army was with him, but the Assembly voted
to surrender. The besiegers entered, Garibaldi
led his Three Thousand in their great retreat,
Mazzini stayed on in Rome uttering such protest
as he could, unharmed by the French troops who
dared not touch him, through knowledge of the
people&rsquo;s love for him.</p>

<p>The downfall of the Republic must have been a
terrible blow to Mazzini, probable as it is that he
foresaw the city could not long last by itself.
Physical force and treachery had overwhelmed
the noblest concepts of government. Temporary
disappointment, however, could not dull his spirit,
the prophet of United Italy proved himself a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
prophet. He went on with his work, at first in
Switzerland, then again driven away by foreign
influence, in London.</p>

<p>He took up his life there, much older, much
more worn and scarred, but with the same indomitable
spirit. &ldquo;His face in repose,&rdquo; wrote a
contemporary of this time, &ldquo;was grave, even sad,
but it lit up with a smile of wonderful sweetness
as he greeted a friend with a pressure rather than
a shake of the thin hand,&rdquo; and again his piercing
black eyes were described as &ldquo;of luminous depth,
full of sadness, tenderness and courage, of purity
and fire, readily flashing into indignation or
humor, always with the latent expression of exhaustless
resolution.&rdquo; His pictures are familiar,
the high straight forehead, the strong nose, the
curving lips, the scant gray, then almost white,
mustache and beard, the high-buttoned frock
coat and the silk handkerchief wound like a stock
about his throat.</p>

<p>London had grown kinder to him than at first,
he had many good friends, and he could understand
better the English point of view. He lodged
as humbly as before, and again took up his
writing, his correspondence, and his ceaseless care
for his poor countrymen. One of his best biographers
gives us this sketch of him, a picture
that portrays the man, &ldquo;in his small room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
every piece of furniture littered with books and
papers, the air thick with smoke of cheap Swiss
cigars (except when friends sent Havanas), brightened
only by his tame canaries and carefully-tended
plants, he was generally writing at his desk
until evening, always with more work in hand than
he could cope with, carrying on the usual mass of
correspondence, writing articles for his Italian
papers, raising public funds with infinite labor,
stirring his English friends to help the cause, finding
money and work for the poor refugees, or organizing
concerts in their interest.&rdquo; With what
infinite reverence must the men he helped have
looked on him!</p>

<p>The prophet is not a statesman; he can show
the road, but rarely follow it. Mazzini&rsquo;s life had
reached its climax when as Triumvir he had
started to practise his own precepts, his work had
been to scatter seed for the crop which other men
should reap at harvest. He could not understand
the dissimulations of diplomacy, he could
not tolerate compromise, he could not now sacrifice
his dreams of a republic for liberty and union.
These qualities were not in his character; if they
had been he could not have led men&rsquo;s minds by his
words and actions; he could not be both a prophet
and an opportunist; the need of the former was
passing, and that of the latter at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Few men understood the twists and turns of
Cavour&rsquo;s policy as Prime Minister of Piedmont,
and Mazzini not at all. After the battle of Novara
Charles Albert had abdicated in favor of his
son Victor Emmanuel, and a new order had come
to pass in Piedmont. Cavour had a definite goal,
the unity of Italy under the leadership of his
king; and he never forgot that goal. To win it,
he realized that he needed more than the raw volunteer
forces of 1848, more than mere enthusiasm,
no matter how heroic; he needed efficient troops,
he needed a foreign ally, he needed a moment when
Austria should be at a disadvantage, above all he
needed one leader instead of a dozen to determine
on any action. To accomplish these ends he gave
republicans little sympathy, and centered the national
movement about his king, he treated with
Louis Napoleon, and did his utmost to win his
favor, he discountenanced secret half-prepared revolts
against the Austrians, he drilled and multiplied
the troops, and harbored the finances. At all
these measures Mazzini instinctively revolted; he
wanted a republic, he loathed Napoleon as the
betrayer of Rome, he was ever eager for any sincere
demonstration against Austria. He only
learned half-truths in London, but those half-truths
did not inspire him to trust Cavour.
Neither of these men understood the other; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Cavour Mazzini was the fanatic who would destroy
any cause by lack of temperance, to Mazzini Cavour
was the aristocrat who would inflict upon
the poor of Italy simply a new yoke in place of
the old. They could not work together, and so
Mazzini publicly denounced Cavour, and the latter
declared Mazzini an exile from his home.</p>

<p>Meantime, while Piedmont was playing a wary
game, and all the Italian states were making
ready for the next great attempt, Mazzini took
part in two small insurrections, one near Como,
and the other at Genoa, both of which failed disastrously.
The latter was the more serious, the
government was tired of these perennial conspiracies,
and denounced the revolt as anarchistic.
Mazzini and five other leaders were sentenced to
death, and many to long terms of imprisonment.
Mazzini hid in the house of the Marquis Pareto,
and was undiscovered, although the police made a
prolonged search for him. It is said that Mazzini
himself, dressed as a footman, opened the door to
the officer, who recognized him as an old schoolmate,
and had mercy. Some days later he escaped
from the house, undisguised, walking arm-in-arm
with a lady of Genoa, and reaching a carriage,
was driven to Quarto, and thence went to
England. There were many curious turns and
twists in this conspiracy in which both conspira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>tors
and government were working for the same
great end, but with widely different means, and
with avowed enmity between them.</p>

<p>It was not long until Cavour and Napoleon met
at Plombi√®res and made their famous compact,
after that events hastened forward. By the
spring of 1859 Cavour had prepared both royalists
and republicans for war. With his ally he
felt that the Italian cause must now triumph, and
at a given signal the conflict began. The Princes
were driven from Tuscany, Romagna, Parma, and
Modena, and all those states declared for Victor
Emmanuel. Much as Mazzini hated Cavour&rsquo;s
French ally, he could no longer stay his enthusiasm.
He saw unity at last almost come, after
Solferino he declared that the Austrian domination
was at an end. Without warning Napoleon
met the Emperor Francis Joseph at Villafranca
and betrayed the cause. He abandoned Venetia
to Austria, and central Italy to the Bourbon
Princes. Cavour, wild with indignation, spoke his
feelings and resigned, the Italians were again left
to their own divided efforts.</p>

<p>Mazzini, his fears of Napoleon now justified,
went to Florence and declared that the people of
central Italy must stake all for their briefly-won
freedom, he gave up his republican protests, and
advocated annexation with Piedmont so they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
have unity. He wrote to friends in Sicily and
Rome, he begged Garibaldi to lead his troops into
Umbria. All this time he had to live virtually in
hiding, the ban against him had not been raised,
and the thought that he, whose every emotion was
for Italy, should not be trusted at all among his
countrymen galled him to the quick. He wrote:
&ldquo;To be a prisoner among our own people is too
much to bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gradually the troubled situation cleared, Cavour
returned to power, and by temporizing held
both the French support and the enthusiasm of
the native troops. Mazzini still advocated immediate
warfare, Cavour waited, and in the end the
latter&rsquo;s policy was proved correct. In the interval
the disheartened Mazzini had gone back to
England, and again, on hearing that Garibaldi
and his famous legion had started for Sicily, returned
in haste to Genoa. There followed Garibaldi&rsquo;s
victories, then the Piedmontese declaration
of war against the Pope, then only Rome and
Venice were lacking to the cause. Mazzini went
to Naples to be nearer the heart of the struggle;
he urged the Neapolitans to demand a constitution,
and they, filled with the one thought of unity,
berated him as a republican. His friends urged
him to leave the city. &ldquo;Even against your wish,&rdquo;
said one of them, &ldquo;you divide us.&rdquo; He could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
leave Italy at that hour of her fate, but he felt
that he was cruelly misunderstood. He wrote, &ldquo;I
am worn out morally and physically; for myself
the only really good thing would be to have unity
achieved quickly through Garibaldi, and one year,
before dying, of Walham Green or Eastbourne,
long silences, a few affectionate words to smooth
the ways, plenty of sea-gulls, and sad dozing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of those things he was to know, for during
the next few years he lived again in England,
writing and reading, and continually engaged in
plans for the final capture of Venetia and Rome.
Victor Emmanuel, Garibaldi, and Mazzini were
each devising means to gain this long-hoped-for
end, but the position and peculiar characteristics
of each made co-operation almost impossible. The
wise Cavour had been succeeded by vacillating
ministers who were a continual drag upon the
King, Garibaldi would not consent to adopting any
of Mazzini&rsquo;s suggestions (the latter once said that
&ldquo;if Garibaldi has to choose between two proposals,
he is sure to accept the one that isn&rsquo;t mine&rdquo;), and
Mazzini found it ever difficult to sacrifice his republican
ideals to the needs of the moment. Ultimately,
however, the Italian troops, this time with
the aid of Prussia, recommenced war with Austria
to win Venetia, Istria, and the Tyrol. The spirit
of 1866 was not the spirit of 1860, the myth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>ical
valor of the Garibaldian army seemed to
have evaporated in the passes of the Tyrol.
Prussia won, but Italy met defeat at Custozza.
Again Napoleon took a hand in the country&rsquo;s
destiny. To the surprise of Europe, he intervened
and stated that Austria had offered to cede
Venetia to him, and that he would give it to Italy
if the latter would come to an immediate agreement
for peace. There seemed little else to be
done, and Mazzini saw the campaign, that had
begun in the highest hopes of complete national
independence, end in the acceptance of the gift of
a single province from the foreigner.</p>

<p>Thenceforth Mazzini&rsquo;s work lost all accord with
that of the monarchy. He had not lost his faith
in the great destiny of Italy, but he despaired of
seeing that destiny fulfilled as he might wish
within his lifetime. Forty thousand persons
signed the petition for his amnesty, he was elected
again and again by Messina as its deputy, but the
party of the Moderates would not have him in the
Chamber. Continued opposition made his fame
only the greater among the people, he assumed the
proportions of a national myth, to many he had
become an actual demi-god. Secretly he traveled
about Italy, working, with an energy altogether
disproportionate to his strength, in the cause of a
republic. He had many followers in Genoa, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
one of them has left a picture of Mazzini&rsquo;s entrance
to a meeting. &ldquo;A low knock was heard at
the door, and there he was in body and soul, the
great magician, who struck the fancy of the people
like a mythical hero. Our hearts leaped, and
we went reverently to meet that great soul. He
advanced with a child&rsquo;s frank courtesy and a
divine smile, shaking hands like an Englishman,
and addressing each of us by name, as if our
names were written on our foreheads. He was
not disguised; he wore cloth shoes, and a capote,
and with his middle, upright stature, he looked like
a philosopher straight from his study, who never
dreamed of troubling any police in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He found time to write his remarkable treatise
on religion, &ldquo;From the Council to God,&rdquo; while he
prepared plans for a new revolution. This time
he intended to land in Sicily. The attempt was
foolhardy, he was arrested at Palermo, and confined
at Gaeta, where the Bourbons had not long
before made their last stand. Almost forty years
before, at the outset of his career, he had watched
the Mediterranean from his prison at Savona, now
he watched the same deep blue sea from Gaeta.
He wrote here, &ldquo;The nights are very beautiful;
the stars shine with a luster one sees only in Italy.
I love them like sisters, and link them to the future
in a thousand ways. If I could choose I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
like to live in almost absolute solitude, working at
my historical book or at some other, just from a
feeling of duty, and only wishing to see for a
moment, now and then, some one I did not know,
some poor woman that I could help, some workingmen
I could advise, the doves of Zurich, and
nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rome fell, and Mazzini&rsquo;s captivity came to an
end. He passed through the city where twenty-one
years before he had been Triumvir, and, seeking
to avoid all popular demonstrations, went to
Genoa. There he fell ill, and his failing strength
made successive attacks more and more frequent.
He traveled a little more, and then in March,
1872, died at a friend&rsquo;s house in Pisa. He had
lived to see Italy united, but in a very different
manner from that of which he had dreamed.</p>

<p>To the republicans of Europe, Mazzini&rsquo;s voice
was that of a great prophet for half the Nineteenth
Century, to the Italians he was the voice of
Italy itself. He was the precursor of unity, of
independence, of courageous self-denial, without
him Cavour might have planned in vain, and Garibaldi
been no more than an inconspicuous lieutenant.
He had the two greatest of gifts, an ideal
and the faith that knows no defeat, yet he was not
simply the idealist nor the devotee, for he could
stir other men to action through his own belief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
A friend, comparing him with Kossuth, said:
&ldquo;Now I write of him who seems to my judgment
to be, like Saul, above all his fellows ... the one
man needed excitement to stir his spirit ... the
soul of the other was as an inner lamp shining
through him always. The strength of Mazzini&rsquo;s
personal influence lay here. You could not doubt
his glance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a certain kinship between Mazzini
and Lincoln, simplicity and a boundless love of the
weak and the oppressed was the keynote of both
lives. Both were emancipators, but both were infinitely
more, men whose whole lives bore eloquent
testimony of their noble spirits. Lincoln loved
men as Mazzini loved them, Mazzini and Lincoln
both knew the suffering that comes from being
continually misunderstood. When Lincoln was
assassinated, the great Italian envied the man who
had died knowing that his life&rsquo;s cause had been
accomplished.</p>

<p>Throughout one of the most tangled and turbulent
epochs of history, Mazzini&rsquo;s ideals never
changed; the principles of &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; were
the principles of his Triumvirate and of his
prison life at Gaeta. He was for a United Italy
and a republic. At times he could postpone the
latter aim for the former, but never disregard it.
And what he was for Italy, he was for the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
world. He insisted on the brotherhood of nations,
on the paramount duty of all nations toward humanity.
Whosoever, he believed, separates families
from families, and nations from nations,
divides what God meant to be indissoluble. He
looked to Italy to show the other nations how to
live in freedom and equality, and to Rome to pronounce
a new and greater religion of majestic
tolerance. Had Italy been freed early in his
career, he must have become a great religious
teacher; even as it was, his power was that of an
apostle, and his appeal to the soul as well as to
the mind. Men who knew him loved him as something
finer than themselves, a man closer to God,
one of His disciples.</p>

<p>His personal life was one long record of self-sacrifice,
his home, his family, his love, his comfort,
even the most meager necessities of life were
given to the cause, nothing was too much for him
to do, nothing too trivial for him to undertake,
could he help his country or one of his countrymen
an iota thereby. He could appreciate other men&rsquo;s
happiness and in a way share it with them; he knew
little or nothing of envy, vanity, or malice; he
would let any leader have the glory of helping
Italy, so long as the result was gained. More
than that, he could bear the continual undervaluation
of the English among whom he lived, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
read what Carlyle wrote, &ldquo;Of Italian democracies
and Young Italy&rsquo;s sorrows, of extraneous Austrian
emperors in Milan, or poor old chimerical
Popes in Bologna, I know nothing and desire to
know nothing,&rdquo; and yet continue Carlyle&rsquo;s friend;
he could bear the sting of having his name coupled
with every attempt at assassination, when there
were few things he abhorred more than secret violence.
His idea of duty was so high, and had so
absorbed all the petty spirits of his nature, that
he could endure anything for that cause, and
indeed embraced eagerly whatever came to him
under that banner.</p>

<p>The great authority on heroes says of the hero
as prophet: &ldquo;The great man was always as
lightning out of Heaven; the rest of men waited
for him like fuel, and then they too would flame.&rdquo;
So the world had waited for Giuseppe Mazzini.
Other men bore much and labored much for the
sake of a united fatherland, but none other gave
such lightning to their world. The prophet may
not actually lay the stones of history, but he
breathes the spirit of life into the builders. He is
mankind&rsquo;s greatest friend and hope, who points
out the road human souls would take. Mazzini
stands with Dante and Savonarola as the third
great prophet of Italian history who spoke with a
world voice.</p>

<h2><a name="CAVOUR_THE_STATESMAN" id="CAVOUR_THE_STATESMAN">CAVOUR, THE STATESMAN</a></h2>


<p class="start-chap"><span class="smcap">Cavour</span> planned united Italy; his career is
a shining example of what may be done by
a man with one definite purpose to which he adheres
without digression. Just as Disraeli seems
from his early manhood to have aimed at becoming
Prime Minister of England so Cavour appears to
have aimed at the union of Italy under the leadership
of Piedmont. There were a thousand and
one points at which he could have turned aside, a
dozen times when a brilliant temporary success
was held before him, but he preferred to sacrifice
no atom of energy or influence which might in
time help in his fundamental purpose. He preferred
obscurity to the danger of being too well
known, and the coldness of contemporaries to the
burden of relations with them which might tend to
shackle his own independence. He read his time
and countrymen with extraordinary accuracy, and
foresaw that what was left of the old r√©gime was
tottering and that to attempt to bolster it up was
absurd. He preferred to let the old conventions of
a departed feudalism go their way in peace while
he prepared himself for the day when the new statecraft
should be recognized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The Piedmont of 1810, the year of Cavour&rsquo;s
birth, was singularly medi√¶val. The militant
strength and daring of the small states of the
Middle Ages had departed, but the point of view
remained. The aristocracy was narrow, bigoted,
and overbearing, they were intolerant of the new
discoveries of science and the useful arts, they devoted
themselves exclusively to the trivial entertainments
of the Eighteenth Century. Napoleon
spread above them like a storm cloud; they
wrapped themselves as well as they could in their
ancestral cloaks and waited, confident that the
gale could not last long. The majority of them
could not believe that the French Revolution was
more than an accident, but there were a few, and
those almost entirely men and women who had lived
abroad, who saw further. One of these latter was
Cavour&rsquo;s grandmother, the Marquise Philippine di
Cavour, from whom he seems to have inherited his
breadth of view.</p>

<p>The family of Benso belonged to the old nobility
of Piedmont, and in time came into possession
of the fief of Santena and the fastness of
Cavour in the province of Pignerolo. A member
of the family who became distinguished for military
services was made Marquis of Cavour by
Charles Emmanuel III., and the eldest son of
Marquis Benso di Cavour married Philippine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
daughter of the Marquis de Sales, a girl brought
up in a ch√¢teau on the Lake of Annecy. The Marquise
Philippine immediately became the controlling
factor in the Cavour household; she strove to
lighten the heavy somberness of her husband&rsquo;s
family in Turin, and at the trying time of the
French occupation sold much of the family plate
and furnishings, and finally certain priceless religious
relics, in order to provide for her son, a
boy of sixteen, when he was ordered to join General
Berthier&rsquo;s corps of the French army. Later
she was commanded to become one of the household
of the Princess Camillo Borghese, sister of Napoleon,
and wife of his governor of Piedmont, who,
better known as Pauline Bonaparte, figures as one
of the most beautiful as well as one of the liveliest
women of that age. The Marquise Philippine
acquitted herself so well and so graciously that the
Princess became one of her staunchest friends, and
with the Prince acted as sponsor at the christening
of the Marquise&rsquo;s second grandchild, Camille di
Cavour. The Marquise&rsquo;s son, Michele Benso, had
married Ad√®le, daughter of the Count de Sellon of
Geneva, and had two sons, Gustave and Camille.
Michele Benso had profited greatly by his mother&rsquo;s
tact, but he was still the unbending reactionary in
nature. So was his eldest son Gustave. It was
the younger boy who received the adaptable genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of the Marquise Philippine, and who seems to have
been best able to appreciate her. On one occasion
he said to her, &ldquo;Marina&rdquo; (a Piedmontese term
for grandmother), &ldquo;we get on capitally, you and
I; you were always a little bit of a Jacobin.&rdquo;
When, as the boy grew older, his family and
friends reproached him with being a fanatical
liberal, he turned to the Marquise, confident that
she understood him. Cavour had few confidants
during his whole life, few friends from whom he
drew inspiration, but his grandmother had so
trained him in the light of her own self-reliant
spirit that he rarely seems to have felt the need
of any outside aid.</p>

<p>The feudal system had scant respect for younger
sons. Gustave was carefully educated for his
proud position, Camille was largely left to grow
up by chance. He was sent to the Military Academy
at Turin, and became a page at the court of
Charles Albert. With both the social and military
life about him he found himself out of temper,
his views were too liberal for the narrowness
he met on every hand, he was hoping for events
which most of his companions could only have
regarded at that time as tragedies. His restlessness
was noted, and he was sent to the lonely
Alpine fortress of Bard. There the soul-wearying
inertia of the military life of a small state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
grew to typify to him the condition of his land.
At the age of twenty-one, he wrote to the Count
de Sellon, &ldquo;The Italians need regeneration; their
morale, which was completely corrupted under the
ignoble dominion of Spaniards and Austrians, regained
a little energy under the French r√©gime,
and the ardent youth of the country sighs for a
nationality, but to break entirely with the past, to
be born anew to a better state, great efforts are
necessary and sacrifices of all kinds must remould
the Italian character. An Italian war would be
a sure pledge that we were going to become again
a nation, that we were rising from the mud in
which we have been trampled for so many centuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such ideas found no sympathy at the court of
Piedmont, and Cavour, confident that the army
could offer him no opportunity to use his talents,
resigned his commission, and induced his father to
buy him a small estate at Leri. There, in the
middle of the rice-fields of Piedmont, Cavour settled
down to the life of a farmer, experimenting
with new steam machinery, canal irrigation, artificial
fertilizers, studying books on government
and agriculture, seeing something of his country
neighbors, waiting for the gradual breakdown of
the old r√©gime. His family were quite content to
let him vegetate on his far-off estate, he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
position in the family household in Turin, his
father and brother were busy with details of court
life, and after the death of his grandmother his
combined family regarded him as lacking in normal
balance. Without becoming actually melancholy
the youth was continually dejected, he saw
no place waiting to be filled by him, he wished that
he had been born into another nation, and sighed,
&ldquo;Ah! if I were an Englishman, by this time I
should be something, and my name would not be
wholly unknown!&rdquo; Yet, indifferent as he seemed
to comradeship, he had at this time one strong
friend, a woman of high birth, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Inconnue,&rdquo; as
he called her in his journal. She summoned him
to her at Turin, and he obeyed her call; she was
unhappy and ardently patriotic, with the visions
of Mazzini, he admired her and was filled with
remorse at the thought of a love so constant and
disinterested. They corresponded for over a
year, and then Cavour&rsquo;s ardor faded. He had
never been in love with her, but she had loved him
devotedly. A few years later she died, and left
him a last letter ending, &ldquo;the woman who loved
you is dead.... No one ever loved you as she
did, no one! For, O Camille, you never fathomed
the extent of her love.&rdquo; She had at least succeeded
in drawing him out of his lonely despair;
platonic as his regard for her seems to have been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
it was the nearest approach to love that entered
his life.</p>

<p>For fifteen years Cavour lived as a farmer at
Leri, breaking the monotony of that existence by
occasional visits to England and France. The
former country always exerted great influence
over him; he considered the life of the English
country gentleman the ideal existence; he was a
great admirer of Pitt and Sir Robert Peel (and
said of Peel that he was &ldquo;the statesman who more
than any other had the instinct of the necessity of
the moment,&rdquo; words prophetic of his own career!),
and was always a reader of Shakespeare, who
among all writers he held had the deepest insight
into the human heart. In Paris Cavour saw much
of society through the influence of his French relations,
and made the most of his opportunity to
study the young rising men. He was frequently
blamed by the men and women he met for leading
such an aimless life, and was urged to enter the
fields of literature or diplomacy. For the former
he said he had no taste, for the latter he was too
much out of sympathy with the government of his
own country, and he could not enter the service of
any other. He had the reputation of being a man
of great wit and intelligence, gifted with gay and
winning manners, interested to a certain extent in
all concerns of the day, but unwilling to sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
himself to a constant devotion to any one pursuit.
The women of the leading salons found his light
hair, blue eyes, and happy temper charming, the
men of the time valued his keen insight into contemporary
questions. He played cards frequently
for high stakes, but never allowed himself to become
an habitual gambler. Later in life it is said
that he indulged in playing for high stakes with
politicians in order to gain an insight into their
characters. His visits to Paris undoubtedly
taught him much concerning the men with whom
he was later to have so much to do, and his stays
in England showed him the strength of Parliamentary
government. He took vivid impressions
back with him to Leri, and used his mental energy
in adapting English ideas on agriculture to the
needs of his farm.</p>

<p>With the governing world of Piedmont Cavour
was undeniably unpopular. The antiquated leaders
of public life considered him perilously liberal,
and no party or clique found him really in accord
with its views. He had written some articles for
foreign newspapers, and had openly advocated the
need of railways in Italy, but such of his countrymen
as undertook to learn his views held him a
dangerous fanatic. Singularly enough, without
having made any attempt to place himself before
the public, he was an object of popular distrust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
He counted this rather an item in his favor, he was
in no wise indebted to any man or any cause. He
preferred to wait until the day of petty reactionaries
should give place to serious popular movements,
and by 1847 he saw that such a crisis was
not far distant. Charles Albert, by nature always
an enigma, was moving forward faster than his
government, and was suspected of strong independent
tendencies.</p>

<p>Charles Albert would have loomed larger in history
if he had been born into either an earlier or
a later age. He was not the man to direct a
political crisis, he would have done well as the
magnanimous sovereign of an Eighteenth Century
state or as the intellectual head of a constitutional
nation, but it was his misfortune to lack those vigorous
robust qualities which Italians later found
in his son. He was an ardent patriot, he earnestly
desired to free the Italian states from foreign
rule, he was zealous that Piedmont should lead in
such a cause, but he was continually afraid that
independence would lead directly to popular liberty
under a constitution. &ldquo;I desire as much as
you do,&rdquo; he said to Roberto d&rsquo;Azeglio, &ldquo;the enfranchisement
of Italy, and it is for that reason,
remember well, that I will never give a constitution
to my people.&rdquo; His advisers, who were largely
clericals, and almost always reactionaries, lost no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
chance to impress upon his mind the impossibility
of the consummation he desired. Start the new
order, they said, and no man knows how far it will
go. He was in fear of loosing a spirit which he
could never cage. Yet his honest desire for national
independence made him hearken at times to
more liberal voices. In one of these moments he
revoked the censorship of the press.</p>

<p>Cavour, primed with the history of England,
saw what a free press meant, and instantly left his
retirement at Leri to seize the golden opportunity.
He founded a newspaper and gave it a name destined
to stand for the whole movement towards
nationalism, &ldquo;<i>Il Risorgimento</i>.&rdquo; The prospectus
of the paper stated its aims as independence,
union between the Princes and the people, and
reforms. Cavour was now prepared to speak his
mind.</p>

<p>He did not have long to wait. The people of
Genoa announced that they were preparing to
send a committee to the capital to ask for the
expulsion of the Jesuits and the organization of a
national guard. The principal editors of Turin
met to consider what stand they should take in
reference to these demands. The suggestion to
support the Genoese petitions was meeting with
general approval when Cavour rose to speak. His
words fell like a bomb, he said that the demands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
were far too small, that the only prudence lay in
asking for much more. The statement was the
keynote to all his later statecraft. &ldquo;Of what
use,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;are reforms which have nothing
definite, and lead to nothing? Where is the good
of asking for that which, whether granted or not,
equally disturbs the State, and weakens the moral
authority of the government? Since the government
can no longer be maintained on its former
basis, let us ask for a constitution, and substitute
for that basis another more conformable to the
spirit of the times, and to the progress of civilization.
Let us do this before it is too late, and before
the authority which keeps society together is
dissolved by popular clamor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cavour&rsquo;s proposal precipitated a violent contest.
Both moderates and liberals thought that
he was asking far too much; Valerio, the leader of
the better element, declared that in asking for a
constitution the meeting went far beyond the
wishes of the people. The meeting broke up without
reaching a decision, but the reports of it scattered
with lightning-like rapidity. Valerio ridiculed
the proposal to his friends and called Cavour
an aper of English customs. He said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know my Lord Camille?&mdash;the greatest reactionist
of the kingdom; the greatest enemy of the revolution,
an Anglomane of the purest breed.&rdquo; Cavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
was nicknamed &ldquo;Milord Camillo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Milord
Risorgimento,&rdquo; he was continually asked if he desired
to erect an English House of Lords.</p>

<p>The ridicule passed, but the suggestion remained.
Charles Albert heard of Cavour&rsquo;s speech
to the editors, and he had already lived through
the first two months of that electrifying year
of 1848. Constitution-making was in the air,
Louis Philippe was falling, the little Italian
Princes were throwing promises to their waking
people. He hesitated, he was under a secret
pledge to continue the government of his country
in the same form in which it had come to him, he
thought seriously of abdicating, but his son,
Victor Emmanuel, opposed the idea vigorously.
Finally, after much anxious thought and many
family consultations, he decided to grant a constitution,
and the famous Statute was given to the
Sardinian kingdom. It is interesting to note that
fifty years later the King&rsquo;s grandson celebrated
the date of the promulgation of what was to become
the charter of Italian independence.</p>

<p>Raised temporarily to a pinnacle of popular
applause, the fickle gusts of an excitable public
opinion soon blew Cavour down to his former
standing. No one really agreed with his opinions,
to the moderates he was still alarmingly audacious,
to the liberals too deeply imbued with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
spirit of English aristocracy. He stood for election
under the new constitution at Turin, and was
defeated; shortly afterwards, however, he was
elected to fill an unexpected vacancy. Count
Balbo, the first Prime Minister under the constitution,
and Cavour&rsquo;s co-editor of the <i>Risorgimento</i>,
did not ask him to join the cabinet, and openly
expressed his disapproval of his fellow-journalist&rsquo;s
ideas. The truth of the matter was that men were
afraid of Cavour, they distrusted him partly because
they did not understand him, and partly
because it was only too evident that if he were
given the chance he would drive the car of state
to suit himself.</p>

<p>The new cabinet had no sooner assumed office
than Milan revolted against the Austrians.
Charles Albert hesitated, he was heart and soul
with the Milanese, but England and Russia both
warned him against war with Austria. His cabinet
was divided, half feared to stake too much,
half were for wagering all. Cavour printed hot
words in the <i>Risorgimento</i>: &ldquo;We, men of calm
minds, accustomed to listen more to the dictates of
reason than to the impulses of the heart, after deliberately
weighing each word we utter, are bound
in conscience to declare that only one path is open
to the nation, the government, the King: war, immediate
war!&rdquo; The evening of the day of publi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>cation
the King decided on war, and Piedmont
rushed to the aid of newly-arisen Lombardy.</p>

<p>The story of that campaign is briefly told,
great confidence, heroic sacrifices, a few victorious
battles, and then the re-enforcement of Radetsky&rsquo;s
army and the retreat to Milan. Sardinia had
brave soldiers, but no great generals, the victories
were not followed up as Napoleon had done on the
same fields. At the battle of Goito Cavour&rsquo;s
nephew, Augusto di Cavour, a boy of twenty, was
killed. On his body was found a last letter from
his uncle encouraging him to do his duty; the blow
was a terrible one for Cavour; he had predicted
the noblest future for Augusto. It is said that he
ever afterward kept the shot-riddled uniform of
the boy in a glass case in his bedroom, a relic and
reminder of heroism.</p>

<p>The war soon came to the tragic climax of Novara,
the ministers were perpetually undecided,
men were thinking more of the possible results of
independence than of the fact itself. There were
a thousand theorists, a thousand phrase-makers,
and in the midst of them all the King, alternately
hopeful and despairing, heroic in his devotion, but
confident that he should never weld Italy together.
Cavour had not been re-elected to the Parliament
of this crucial time, he was outside the battle
proper, striving to direct public sentiment through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
his paper, and watching and studying the strength
and weakness of the cause. The battle of Novara
ended the war, Charles Albert abdicated, and
Victor Emmanuel came to the Sardinian throne.
The natures of father and son were almost diametrically
opposed, the new King was the born leader,
his people could not doubt the temper of his resolution,
and it was upon that implicit trust that Cavour,
determined on one and only one adviser, was
to build a state that should be firm and enduring.
In a sense failure had cleared the field for greater
achievement as success could never have done.</p>

<p>The new King, having sworn allegiance to the
constitution, cast about him for a prime minister
who could bring order out of seeming chaos, and
chose Massimo d&rsquo;Azeglio, then and for long
afterwards the best beloved man in Piedmont.
D&rsquo;Azeglio was a painter, a poet, a warrior, and an
accomplished man of the world, devoted to his
country, liberal without being radical. He was
the one man to restore popular confidence in the
Sardinian kingdom, Cavour was glad that the
King&rsquo;s favor had fallen on such a man, and, knowing
that his own assistance at that time would only
serve to embarrass the new Premier, he retired to
the leisure he enjoyed so thoroughly on his farm at
Leri. Here he rested and recovered some of the
confidence which had been shaken by the unfor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>tunate
trend of events. He was by nature optimistic,
and knew the value of gradual development,
the hours he spent in farming he considered most
valuably employed. A friend described him about
this time as having a very fresh-colored complexion,
and blue eyes, which although still exceedingly
bright, had a changeful expression. He was
stout, but not ungainly as he became later. He
stooped slightly, but when he stopped to speak to
any one held himself erect in an attentive attitude.
His forehead, large and solid, gave strength to a
face which was not distinguished by striking features;
on either side of his mouth, which was rather
cold and contained, were two lines which, by
trembling or contracting, gave the only sign of
any emotion to an observer. His voice was low,
and not remarkably inspiring, he never had the
orator&rsquo;s fluent tongue with which to sway his
auditors. He was always courteous and at his
ease, easily approachable and interested in whatever
might be said to him. He belonged to the
class of statesmen who tell very little of their
thoughts. When he visited Manzoni on Lake
Maggiore, and the latter poured out to him his
dreams of a united Italy, which as he said he
usually kept to himself for secret fear of being
thought a madman, Cavour answered simply by
rubbing his hands, and with a slow smile saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
&ldquo;We shall do something.&rdquo; The act and the words
bespoke his character.</p>

<p>Cavour&rsquo;s holiday in the country was not to last
long, the King dissolved his first Parliament, and
in the second Cavour was re-elected to his former
seat. Now for the first time he made his real
power felt in the Chamber, on the question of the
abolition of those special courts which had formerly
existed for the trial of ecclesiastic offenders
against the common law. The struggle between
the clericals and liberals was bitter. Cavour
spoke on March 7, 1850, and advocated strong
measures. He was not anxious to force the
Church into a position hostile to the State, but he
feared peace purchased at a heavy sacrifice. He
knew that reforms must be full and sweeping if
they were to stem the rising tide of European discontent.
The wisest statesmen were those who,
like Lord Grey and Sir Robert Peel in England,
had granted fully when they recognized the temper
of the time. Revolutions were only to be
stayed by real reforms. If real reforms were
granted, the government of Piedmont, he concluded,
would not only be strong among its own
people, but &ldquo;gathering to itself all the living
forces in Italy, it would be in a position to lead our
mother-country to those high destinies whereunto
she is called.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first speech which had thrilled with
hope since the lamentable downfall of Novara.
The audience in the galleries caught the prophetic
note and cheered it to the echo. The ministers
were eager to shake hands with the speaker. The
people were stirred, although not yet convinced
that Cavour was what he seemed to be, but public
men throughout Italy recognized that here was a
strong man with potent forces soon to be considered.</p>

<p>Soon after the passage of the bill Cavour had
advocated, one of D&rsquo;Azeglio&rsquo;s ministers, Count
Pietro di Santa Rosa, died. Immediate pressure
was brought to bear to make Cavour his successor,
but for a long time D&rsquo;Azeglio, although friendly
to Cavour, hesitated to take such an extremist into
his cabinet. Finally he offered Cavour the post
of Minister of Agriculture and Commerce. Cavour
accepted, but only after making certain
terms, one of which was that a certain minister
whom he considered over-timorous should be asked
to resign. D&rsquo;Azeglio agreed, though with ill
grace, and in consequence was shortly after told
by the King, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that this man will
turn you all out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On taking office Cavour gave up his connection
with the <i>Risorgimento</i>, a paper which he considered
had helped the liberal projects immeasurably. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Minister of Commerce he negotiated trade treaties
with England, France, and Belgium. He took to
work so readily that very shortly he was made
Minister of Marine in addition to his original post.
Gradually he won his way to the leadership in
Parliament, speaking for himself rather than for
the cabinet, and having small regard for the professed
opinions of his own or any other party.
When a deputy would ask him for information in
the Chamber he would state his own opinion, and
where that differed from opinions already expressed
by his colleagues he would make his favorite reply,
that he spoke &ldquo;less as a minister than as a politician.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cavour&rsquo;s many-sided nature rapidly showed itself
in his stand on religious and educational measures,
on trade and commerce, on theories of
government and practical applications. There
seemed to be no field with which he was not conversant,
and which he could not straighten of
tangles less thoughtful ministers had made. In
April, 1851, he became Minister of Finance, having
insisted that Nigra, his predecessor, should
resign if he were to remain. The Minister of
Public Instruction had a disagreement with
Cavour, and was replaced by one of the latter&rsquo;s
friends, Farini, the Romagnol exile, a strong nationalist
writer. These changes greatly strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>ened
Cavour&rsquo;s position and were all in line with his
policy of making Piedmont a strong constitutional
state, its people imbued with the thought of leadership
in any struggle for Italian unity. Abroad he
was endeavoring in every way to excite interest in
Italian conditions, he was an enthusiastic admirer
of Mr. Gladstone, he studied Louis Napoleon&rsquo;s
giant strides to power, not for their effect upon
liberty, but in search of indications that the new
French r√©gime would listen to the voice of Victor
Emmanuel. He had come to realize that foreign
aid was essential to ultimate victory, and looked to
France as the most probable ally. That this ally
was likely to appear in the garb of a political adventurer
did not disturb him; as he said, &ldquo;Franklin
sought the help of the most despotic monarch
in Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To insure that when Piedmont should succeed in
enlisting foreign aid the country might be consolidated
and ready, Cavour planned a great
stroke, to combine his own party in Parliament
with that of the Moderate Liberals, or Left Center,
as it was called. None of the four parties was
sufficiently strong in itself to insure any permanent
success, but a combination of the two Center
parties would allow for plans of certain durability.
Rattazzi, probably the most brilliant speaker in the
House, and a man of much popularity, was leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of the Left Center, and to him Cavour broached
his plans. The alliance was concluded in January,
1852, and kept a secret for some time.
Finally, in a debate on a bill aimed to moderate
newspaper attacks on foreign sovereigns, the ministry
was violently attacked, and Rattazzi announced
his compact with Cavour by stating that
he intended generally to support the ministry in
the present session unless there should be some decided
change in its policy. Cavour, speaking in
reply, acknowledged the alliance between the two
parties.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Azeglio and the other ministers had been kept
in the dark, and were as much surprised as was
the general public. Cavour had feared that a discussion
of the wisdom of such an alliance might
have ended in disagreement, and he was determined
that the plan should be put through. That seems
to have been the only excuse for keeping the plan
secret from his colleagues. The Prime Minister
was highly indignant, but would not disown
Cavour&rsquo;s act; he merely intimated to him that he
would never sit in the same cabinet with Rattazzi.
Shortly afterward Cavour lent his support to
electing Rattazzi President of the Chamber.
D&rsquo;Azeglio was again indignant, and Cavour felt
that it was best that he should leave the ministry.
He resigned, and was followed by all the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
ministers. Their act, however, was purely a matter
of sentiment, and the King commanded them
to remain at their posts. Cavour endorsed this
command, he saw no reason why D&rsquo;Azeglio&rsquo;s ministry
should not continue for a time without him.
He parted on the best of terms with the Premier,
and in order that his presence might cause no embarrassment
to the reconstructed ministry started
on a journey to France and England.</p>

<p>This trip abroad came at a most opportune
time. It gave Cavour a chance to meet French
and English statesmen and learn their views of his
policy of allying Rattazzi&rsquo;s party with his own in
order to obtain a working majority. He knew
that Rattazzi was generally regarded as a reckless
revolutionary, but he found that the necessity of
using his aid was generally acknowledged. Cavour
talked with the leaders of each party in England;
he found Lord Palmerston then as always his ardent
friend and admirer. Palmerston saw that the
overthrow of the Italian tyrannies must depend
upon the home strength of the Sardinian government,
and that if that government were once firmly
established on a constitutional basis it could not
be long before Austria would be driven out of
Italy. Palmerston promised Cavour the moral
support of England, and the Italian left London
delighted at what he had learned there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>In Paris Cavour met Thiers, who bade him be of
good courage, and the Prince President. To the
latter he devoted much time, and succeeded in
making a deep impression upon the astute Napoleon.
&ldquo;Whether we like it or not,&rdquo; the Italian
wrote from Paris, &ldquo;our destinies depend on
France; we must be her partner in the great game
which will be played sooner or later in Europe.&rdquo;
In the French capital Cavour found several leaders
of Italian life who were living in exile; he
visited Daniel Manin, the great Venetian, the idol
of his city, and learned from him something of
Venetian hopes. He also saw the many-sided Gioberti,
&ldquo;the same child of genius, who would have
been a great man had he had common-sense,&rdquo; said
Cavour, the man who had once dreamt of a free
Italy under the leadership of a great liberal Pope,
and who was now in a book about to be published
to show his gift of prescience by fixing on Cavour
as the one man who understood the essentials of
the new Italian civilization.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Azeglio was facing a ministerial crisis when
Cavour returned to his home, and, ill with the
wound he had received in the last war, besought
the King to let him retire from office. He suggested
that Victor Emmanuel summon Cavour,
&ldquo;who,&rdquo; he wrote at this time, &ldquo;you know is diabolically
active, and fit in body and soul, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
he enjoys it so much!&rdquo; The King asked Cavour
to form a ministry, naming certain restrictions,
the chief one being to come to a friendly agreement
with the Pope on the matter of civil marriage,
but Cavour felt that to do this would be to
start his work under a handicap. He suggested
Count Balbo as Premier, but the latter had too
small a following, and the King, judging that his
country needed the strong hand of Cavour at the
helm more than the friendship of Rome, asked him
to form his cabinet without imposing any conditions
whatever.</p>

<p>So came into existence what was to be known in
Italian history as the &ldquo;<i>Gran Ministero</i>,&rdquo; the first
in which Cavour was openly to proclaim his plans.
It is curious to note that even now, when he had
become the most considerable figure in Piedmont,
he was not generally popular. The King did not
altogether like him, the public men could not even
now understand him, the people scarcely knew the
real man at all. What King, public men, and
people did know was that Cavour was a man of
tremendous force, and a man destined to lead other
men. At this time there commenced to grow up in
Piedmont that blind faith in Cavour which later
assumed such great proportions that the people
felt that he must have his own way no matter what
they might think of it, because Cavour&rsquo;s way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
meant victory, no matter how little they might
anticipate it.</p>

<p>Cavour chose to be President of the Council and
Minister of Finance, and at once set to work to
increase the resources of the country. The history
of his work at this time is that of an administrator
preparing with scrupulous care each detail
against a coming need. He strengthened fortifications,
he allowed La Marmora a free hand in the
development of the army, he completed the railway
system, he used all possible means to stimulate industry
and increase agricultural output. He
instituted new taxes, cut down the salt tax, and
introduced certain free-trade measures. He followed
a definite plan of preparation, regardless of
popular opinion, which at one time turned so
fiercely against him on the ground that he was a
monopolist who was robbing the poor of bread,
that his life was in danger at the hands of a
mob.</p>

<p>Cavour had one concern, to strengthen the central
government of his country, and he labored for
that with little regard for other things. He was
accused, particularly after Rattazzi had joined his
cabinet, of seeking to win certain constituencies by
promises of local aid if they would return his candidate.
He understood too well the uncertain
temper of the people to take any unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
risks, he knew that the work he was doing was
essential for Italian independence, and he was willing
to obtain his support as best he could. What
concerned him was the fact of support, not the
reason. His ultimate purpose required that the
country be kept at peace until it should have
reached full strength, and for this end Cavour
tried to make friends with Austria, dissembling his
real feelings as cleverly as he could, and sought
confidence and friendly offices. To this end he
discountenanced Mazzini&rsquo;s attempt at revolution
in Milan in February, 1853; he knew that conditions
were not ready for success; he regarded
Mazzini&rsquo;s faith in blind outbreaks of the people as
a deterrent factor in his preparation for ultimate
success.</p>

<p>Western Europe was making ready for war in
the Crimea, England and France were aligning
themselves against Russia. Cavour felt what was
coming, and conceived a step of marvelous daring.
With his old belief in the prudence of audacity he
determined to join Sardinia to France and England,
to stake the future of his little kingdom on
an alliance with the two great western Powers. He
felt that Sardinia must now step forward as a
nation or retire to the great group of little principalities.
He could not tell what position Austria
would take, but he resolved no matter how that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
country might side, to cast his lot with the west.
When one recalls the size of Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s
kingdom and its resources Cavour&rsquo;s audacity becomes
well-nigh inconceivable. When his intention
was made known to the people they gaped in
amazement, after these years of preparation why
should they hazard all on a purely foreign war,
why leave their borders unguarded to the Austrians?
Cavour stood firm and unshaken, Victor
Emmanuel, trusting to his minister&rsquo;s star of
destiny, stood by him, the people stormed, protested,
besought, but all without avail. Cavour
had decided that it was time to act, and so it must
be time, the people had learned that there was
no use in arguing with him, what he must do he
must, they became fatalists under his colossal will.
A demand of a guarantee of certain restrictions
against Austria was sought by Cavour&rsquo;s ministry,
but the western Powers would not give it. England
and France would both be glad to have Sardinia
as an ally, but would make no promises of
future help. The Sardinian Foreign Minister resigned
when the attempt to obtain a guarantee
failed. Cavour offered the position to D&rsquo;Azeglio,
but he declined it, and so, on January 10, 1855,
Cavour assumed the portfolio of Foreign Affairs
himself, and on the same day signed the agreement
binding Sardinia to an offensive and defensive alli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>ance
with France and England. It was the first
step towards making Italy again a world power.</p>

<p>Cavour had decided to show Europe that an
Italian government could live under a liberal constitution,
and that an Italian army could fight.
He believed that both Lord Palmerston and the
French Emperor were convinced of the former
fact; he was now anxious to convince them of the
latter. As matters fell out Austria remained
neutral, and the allies opposed Russia alone. Napoleon,
thirsting for glory for French arms, was
little disposed to give the Sardinian forces a
chance, and wished to keep them as a reserve at
Constantinople. It required the greatest diplomacy
on Cavour&rsquo;s part to obtain opportunities for
his troops, but when he did they more than justified
him. Their spirit and powers of endurance
were admirable, they seemed consciously to feel
that they were being made ready for a greater and
more sacred combat. In August the Piedmontese
troops won a victory on the Tchernaia, Turin was
delighted, and Cavour felt that his great step was
being justified. The King wrote to General La
Marmora, &ldquo;Next year we shall have war where we
had it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at this time that Victor Emmanuel visited
England and France. Cavour accompanied him,
and, as always, made a close study of opinions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
both those countries. He found Queen Victoria
and Prince Albert deeply interested in Italian
affairs, and strongly favorable to Piedmont&rsquo;s
hopes. Napoleon, he found, was determined to
end the war in the Crimea.</p>

<p>In February, 1856, peace was declared. Austria,
which had remained neutral, was apparently
the greatest gainer by the war. At home the Sardinian
government had been seriously disturbed
over the question of suppression of the religious
houses, a measure which Cavour and a majority
of the people favored, but which the King was
very loath to accept. After the Chamber of
Deputies had passed the measure by an overwhelming
majority, and it was being considered by the
Senate, two ecclesiastics wrote to the King, promising
to pay into the national treasury the sum
the government expected to realize from the suppressions.
Victor Emmanuel, who was an ardent
Churchman, conceived that this would be a most
satisfactory settlement of the whole matter, and
suggested to Cavour that he agree. Cavour saw
the impossibility of compromise at that hour, and
declined, offering at the same time his resignation.
The King, who was never quite at his ease with
Cavour, and who thought he was now in a position
to dispense with his services, accepted the
resignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>When the people heard of the proposed compromise
they were brought to an angry crisis, and
for a moment it looked as though all the past careful
efforts to establish a stable government might
go for nothing. Then D&rsquo;Azeglio, with rare courage,
wrote to the King, and pointed out the dangers
that lay in his new course. He entreated him
not to align himself with the reactionaries, he
pointed out how such a step had caused the downfall
of both Stuart and Bourbon thrones. The
people desired the measure, it was too late now to
withdraw it from the Senate. Victor Emmanuel
heeded the words of his old counselor, recalled
Cavour to office, and allowed the bill, practically
as at first presented, to become law. This was the
next great step in the progress towards a united
Italy.</p>

<p>At the time of his last visit to Paris Cavour had
been asked by Napoleon to submit a note of what
France could do for Italy. This Cavour now prepared,
asking little at this time, the main object
being the Austrian evacuation of Bologna. Cavour
found himself in a very difficult position, the war
had closed before Austria had been drawn into it,
and Sardinia was not in a sufficiently strong position
to make many requests. Both the King and
Cavour had confidently hoped that Austria would
be forced to side with Russia. Now it was ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>tremely
doubtful what decisions the coming Congress
of Paris would make, and Cavour had been
privately given to understand that the Sardinian
envoy to the Congress would only be allowed to
attend those sessions which concerned Sardinia,
and not to take his place with the envoys of the
great Powers. He was exceedingly anxious that
D&rsquo;Azeglio should attend, but the latter refused
point-blank when he learned of the subservient
position he would in all probability have to take.
Under these circumstances Cavour saw no alternative
but to go himself, and so with considerable
misgiving he set out for Paris, intent on observing
and planning rather than on asking favors that
might be unceremoniously refused.</p>

<p>The Congress of Paris of 1856 produced results
far different from those the various plenipotentiaries
intended. Austria came to Paris in the
enviable position of the great European peace-maker,
she left as tyrannical upholder of the old
r√©gime. Cavour came as the representative of a
small state with interests far inferior to those of
the other nations, he left as the moral champion of
the much abused peninsula of Italy. Austria
actually conceded no territory and Sardinia
gained none, but Austria was discredited in the
eyes of England and France, and Sardinia more
than justified. Cavour achieved a great moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
victory, perhaps the greatest result any statesman
can gain from a treaty of peace. He did not take
a very prominent part in the actual meetings, he
was very reserved, a good listener, a courteous and
always affable companion. He was loyal to both
his English and his French allies, he won over the
Russian Count Orloff, and contrived to keep on
good terms with the Austrian Count Buol, whom he
had formerly known at Turin. He waited with
indomitable patience until the major matters of
the Congress had been discussed and disposed of,
then he addressed a note to the English and
French envoys inquiring into the rights of Austria
to remain in occupation of the Roman Legations.
The question was most important, it struck at the
discussion of the temporal power of the Pope, inasmuch
as that power in Romagna was dependent
upon Austrian support. Moreover it gave notice
that Sardinia was concerning itself with the
affairs of the other Italian states.</p>

<p>Cavour had other projects, he was anxious to
reunite Parma and Modena with Piedmont, he was
eager to have their Lombard estates returned to
those Italians concerned in the last revolt against
Austria. He planned and plotted to accomplish
both these ends, and waited. The treaty of peace
was signed on March 30, and then the French
President of the Congress, Count Walewski, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
another session by order of the Emperor. This
session was to deal with the Austrian and French
occupation of Naples. The difficulty with regard
to Cavour&rsquo;s original note was that in questioning
Austria&rsquo;s right to uphold the Pope in Romagna it
also questioned France&rsquo;s right to occupy Rome for
the same purpose. Cavour spoke on the Austrian
occupation, but passed over the French. It seems,
however, that Napoleon, who had originally taken
Rome to please the clerical party, was now willing
to withdraw from Rome if he could do so without
offending that party, and at the same time cause
Austria to withdraw. Lord Clarendon, the British
plenipotentiary, urged the withdrawal of both
Powers, which he claimed stood on the same footing.
He objected to both occupations as disturbing
to the balance of power, he denounced the government
of the King of Naples, he found occasion
to say what the most ardent Italian would have
liked to say, and his unreserved ardor gained
added force from the caution of Cavour. The
effect of the Englishman&rsquo;s speech was striking, he
put into words all Cavour&rsquo;s contentions, and left
the Italian in the enviable position of having demanded
nothing, but of having all the claims of
justice on his side. The Austrian envoy was indignant,
and the session adjourned without tangible
result. The impression left upon every one&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
mind, however, was that Sardinia had championed
Italy against Austria, and that it intended to prepare
to make its championship more definite than
by diplomatic notes.</p>

<p>Cavour returned to Turin with the satisfaction
of having placed Italy&rsquo;s wrongs openly before the
world. The redress of these wrongs was now matter
for European consideration, no longer the
mere object of secret society plots. Patriots in
all the Italian states were quick to realize this,
they saw that at last their national rights had
been forced into attention, Cavour&rsquo;s note had cemented
all their local causes. There were still
many in Piedmont who did not understand his
policy, and many who would have preferred his
winning of a single duchy to Sardinia rather than
urging the withdrawal of Austria from the Papal
States, but in spite of these doubters the great
majority acclaimed his cause, and felt that,
whether they understood him or not, he was the
one man who could lead them to deliverance. On
his return his policy became more clear, he was
aiming at an Italian nation under one king, he was
looking far ahead, and the other great nationalists
who had been puzzled by his conflicting declarations
in the past saw that his goal was theirs. The
goal had unquestionably been in his thoughts
throughout all his political career, now he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
out frankly, no longer simply Prime Minister of
Sardinia, but spokesman for Italy.</p>

<p>War must come as the next step. Cavour now
for the first time took account of the practical use
to be made of those great waves of popular feeling
that were continually recurring, those heroic
forces Mazzini had been calling into being. He
met Garibaldi, and found that he was a great practical
man, likely to be of infinite value to the
country. He went among the people and studied
how their enthusiasms could be turned to best account,
he planned with leaders of earlier revolts
and convinced them that he was simply patient
until the time came to strike, no more a reactionary
than they.</p>

<p>In addition to the Foreign Office Cavour assumed
the Ministry of Finance. He was unwilling
to trust too much to other men, he was anxious to
know exactly how all the affairs of the nation
stood. The army he knew was rapidly improving,
he studied how he might increase the finances without
imposing too heavy taxes. He moved the
arsenal from Genoa to Spezia, he insisted on completing
the tunneling of Mont Cenis, and all these
steps showed that he was concerned now with the
affairs of the whole peninsula rather than with the
guidance of one small state. As one of his political
opponents said of him in detraction at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
time, &ldquo;the Prime Minister had all Italy in view,
and was preparing for the future kingdom.&rdquo; He
had made himself practically the entire government,
from King to peasant all classes followed
him with a blind faith in his triumphant destiny as
a leader. Still he waited, preparing for the hour
to strike.</p>

<p>On the evening of January 14, 1858, Felice
Orsini, a Romagnol revolutionist, attempted to
assassinate the French Emperor with a bomb as he
was driving to the opera. It was expected that
this act would cause a bitter estrangement between
France and Italy, but, although for a short time
there was a considerable diplomatic interchange of
notes, the ultimate result was quite the reverse.
We must remember that the wrongs under which
Italy labored were in reality always on Napoleon&rsquo;s
mind, that he sincerely desired to free and reunite
the Italian nation, although at times his ideas of
expediency made him appear more of an enemy
than a friend. As a young man he had himself
been a revolutionary, probably at one time a member
of the Carbonari, he had thrilled long ago at
Mazzini&rsquo;s call, and he was an ardent nationalist.
When he heard Orsini&rsquo;s last words to him, &ldquo;Free
my country, and the blessings of twenty-five million
Italians will go with you!&rdquo; he knew that it
was not hatred of himself, but the desire in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
way to bring about Italian independence that had
inspired the assassin. The words and acts of Napoleon
wind in and out of this story of Italian
liberation in a manner only too often difficult to
reconcile, but it would seem that his interest was
in reality sincere, and that he wished to help Italy
as much as he could without jeopardizing the interests
of France.</p>

<p>Events began to march, certain ideas were exchanged
between influential persons at Paris and
Turin; in June Dr. Conneau, an intimate of the
Emperor, happened to visit Turin, and saw Victor
Emmanuel and Cavour. It was stated that Napoleon
intended to make a private visit to Plombi√®res.
Shortly after Cavour announced that his
health required a change of scene and that he
should go away into the mountains. By a strange
coincidence he also went to Plombi√®res. Napoleon
saw him, they spent two days closeted together;
when Cavour left the two men understood each
other. The details of what was known as the Pact
of Plombi√®res are not positive, the understanding
appears to have been that a rising in Massa and
Carrara should give a pretext for a war to expel
the Austrians. After such expulsion the country
in the valley of the Po, the Roman Legations, and
the Ancona Marches were to be united in a kingdom
of Upper Italy. Savoy was to be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to France, possession of Nice was left unsettled,
Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s daughter, the Princess
Clotilde, was to be given in marriage to Prince
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Napoleon had shown his interest in Italy, but
Cavour left Plombi√®res fully alive to the fact that
actual help was still far distant. Austria would
be hard to defeat, and Cavour did not wish France
to provide all the forces for war. He already
foresaw that it might be difficult to insure
France&rsquo;s withdrawal after victory. Furthermore
he realized that England, to which he was always
looking, was well content with the present peaceful
situation of affairs, and would regard any offensive
step by France or Sardinia as unwarrantable.
He saw that Prussia and Russia held the same
view. No country wanted war except his own,
and possibly France, provided it could be made to
appear that Austria and not France was the attacking
party. It seemed very certain that Austria
would stand much before putting herself in
the false position of wantonly opening war.
Again Cavour had to be patient and plan how
Austria might be made to take that step.</p>

<p>While he waited Cavour organized a volunteer
Italian army under the name of the Hunters of
the Alps, he laid campaign plans with Garibaldi,
he knit all the patriots of Italy into one common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
cause. Even the old conservative leaders came
over to him, D&rsquo;Azeglio wrote him, &ldquo;To-day it is
no longer a question of discussing your policy, but
of making it succeed.&rdquo; The King supported him
magnificently, Cavour found that his hardest work
now was to hold King and people back. Still he
would not open war, he knew too well that he must
have the support of other countries than his own.</p>

<p>At the New Year&rsquo;s Day reception in Paris,
1859, Napoleon made his famous comment to the
Austrian Ambassador, &ldquo;I regret that relations between
us are so strained; tell your sovereign, however,
that my sentiments for him are still the
same.&rdquo; The words created a sensation, no one was
certain what lay back of them in the French Emperor&rsquo;s
mind. Cavour heard them and they gave
him hope. When the time came for Victor Emmanuel
to open Parliament Cavour prepared the
speech from the Throne with the greatest care and
had a copy submitted in advance to Napoleon.
Napoleon strengthened it, and Victor Emmanuel
changed it still further for the better. When the
King read it the effect upon his hearers was that
of a call to arms in an heroic cause. &ldquo;If Piedmont,
small in territory, yet counts for something
in the councils of Europe, it is because it is great
by reason of the ideas it represents and the sympathies
it inspires. This position doubtless creates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
for us many dangers; nevertheless, while respecting
treaties, we cannot remain insensible to the cry
of grief that reaches us from so many parts of
Italy.&rdquo; The European Powers saw that the old
treaties of 1815 were in imminent danger. None
of them realized who had in reality penned these
words.</p>

<p>Cavour was now at one of the great crises of his
life work, and bending every effort to secure Napoleon&rsquo;s
consent to a definite treaty. He succeeded
in that the Emperor, delighted at the marriage of
Prince Napoleon to a princess of one of the oldest
houses in Europe, directed the bridegroom to sign
an agreement obligating France to come to Piedmont&rsquo;s
aid should the latter nation be subjected to
any overt act of aggression on the part of Austria.
This agreement was intended to be kept altogether
secret, but rumors that a treaty had been
signed crept abroad. Cavour now waited for Austria&rsquo;s
aggressive act, and sought to gain national
loans at home, and to arouse interest on Piedmont&rsquo;s
behalf abroad. The English government would
not enthuse over Italian wrongs, they were zealous
to maintain the present footing, but Cavour maintained
his diplomatic suavity and kept the English
friendship against the day when he might need it
against France.</p>

<p>The spring of 1859 saw the natural crisis rap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>idly
approaching, Mazzini&rsquo;s world forces again
ready to break loose. Into Piedmont swarmed the
youth of all northern Italy, girt with sword and
gun, palpitant for strife. The government could
not hold the rising tide much longer. Cavour exclaimed,
&ldquo;They may throw me into the Po, but I
will not stop it!&rdquo; And yet he had to wait. Austria
must first act on the offensive. The last week
of Lent came and Cavour stood face to face with
the climax that was to make or mar his plans.</p>

<p>The story of those two weeks is tremendously
dramatic. The Russian government proposed a
Congress of the Powers at Paris to adjust the disordered
state of Italy. England and Prussia
agreed, Austria accepted subject to the two conditions
that Piedmont should disarm and that she
should be excluded from the Congress. The French
Minister, Count Walewski, said for Napoleon that
France could not plunge into war on Piedmont&rsquo;s
account, and that Piedmont was not entitled to a
voice in the Congress. Napoleon seemed to have
listened to the counsels of the Empress and his
ministers, who were opposed to war, and Cavour
found himself without a spokesman. It was a
black hour when he wrote to the Emperor that
Italy was desperate; in reply he was called to
Paris. He saw Napoleon, but obtained no promise
of help. He threatened that Victor Emmanuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
would abdicate, he himself go to America and publish
all the correspondence between Napoleon and
himself. He used every entreaty, but to no effect.
He returned to Turin, where he was met with the
wildest demonstrations of regard.</p>

<p>Now England made a suggestion, the government
proposed that all the Italian states should
be admitted to the proposed Congress, and that
Austria as well as Piedmont should disarm. The
French government considered this a happy proposal,
and wrote to Cavour strongly recommending
consent. The Minister understood what the
disbanding of all his volunteers, the reduction of
his army, would mean to Italy, but he saw no
choice but to submit. All the Powers were against
him, either course seemed to presage absolute defeat.
On April 17 he sent a note agreeing to the
disarming, and gave himself up to despair. History
says that he was on the point of committing
suicide, and was only saved by a devoted friend
who pleaded with him. At the end of a long
stormy scene Cavour controlled himself. &ldquo;Be tranquil;
we will face it together,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Fortune changed; the very day on which Cavour
submitted, the Austrian government replied
slightingly to the English proposal and stated
that Austria would itself call upon Piedmont to
disarm. It was an error of the first magnitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the act of aggression for which Cavour had so
long waited. At the time Austria was probably
ignorant of Napoleon&rsquo;s secret agreement with
Piedmont, and also that Cavour had consented to
disarm. The fact of Piedmont&rsquo;s submission to the
wishes of France and England, and Austria&rsquo;s arbitrary
note, revolutionized the situation. Piedmont
was saved by a marvelous turn of fortune.</p>

<p>April 25, while the Piedmont Chamber was conferring
absolute powers on the King, Cavour was
handed a note, on which was written: &ldquo;They are
here. I have seen them.&rdquo; &ldquo;They&rdquo; meant the
Austrian envoys. Cavour left the Chamber, saying,
&ldquo;It is the last Piedmontese parliament which
has just ended; next year we will open the first
Italian parliament.&rdquo; He met the envoys and read
their message, the Sardinian army to be put on a
peace footing, the Italian volunteers to be disbanded;
an answer, yes or no, to be given within
three days. If that answer is unsatisfactory to
Austria a resort to arms.</p>

<p>Cavour accepted the three days allowed him in
order to push his preparations, then he replied to
the Austrian note, saying that Piedmont had
agreed to the English proposals with the assent
of Prussia, Russia, and France, and that he had
nothing further to add. He took leave of the Austrian
envoys courteously, and then, radiantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
happy, joined his colleagues, saying, &ldquo;The die is
cast.&rdquo; Fortune had stood by him and had placed
Piedmont in the most enviable position he could
have wished. He had staked everything on his acquiescing,
with scarcely one chance of success,
but that chance had come and he had won.</p>

<p>The war opened with the victory of the allies
at Magenta, Milan was free, and at Solferino the
Italians and French gained Lombardy. The Sardinian
army won its spurs gloriously. Cavour,
who had sent La Marmora to lead the troops, and
had himself become Minister of War, showed the
greatest skill in attending to his army&rsquo;s commissariat.
At the same time he was watching the rest
of Italy, Parma and Modena returned to the old
alliance of 1848, and Cavour sent special commissioners
to control them. He was anxious that all
the states should unite. He was constantly afraid
that one of the Powers would step in and seize
Tuscany. He kept his eye on Florence and supported
the efficient dictatorship of Ricasoli.</p>

<p>Mazzini had prophesied to Cavour some months
earlier: &ldquo;You will be in the camp in some corner
of Lombardy when the peace which betrays Venice
will be signed without your knowledge.&rdquo; That
was exactly what happened. On July 6 Napoleon
opened negotiations at Villafranca with Austria
for peace. Perhaps he had learned that the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
people were no longer enthusiastic over the war
and wished to devote himself to his own defense,
perhaps he saw that victories were building up a
stronger Italy than he cared to have, perhaps he
feared a possible intervention by Prussia. His
whole conduct towards Italy was one of most perplexing
changes, certain it is that he now deliberately
threw away all the advantages of victory
and made every loyal Italian his enemy. Had he
been more of a statesman he would have foreseen
the consequences of his acts. The terms of the
peace were that Venice should be left to Austria,
Modena, Tuscany, and Romagna given back to
their petty Princes, the Pope made president of a
league in which Austria was to be a party. It
was the basest betrayal of Italian hopes. Cavour
was absolutely prostrated, he saw all his wonderful
plans shattered beyond redemption, he saw himself
totally dishonored in the sight of the people
he had led into war. He rushed to the camp of
Victor Emmanuel and advised him either to abdicate
or fight on alone. In that moment the King
rose superior to his great Minister, he decided to
sign the treaty and to wait. Victor Emmanuel,
more bitterly disappointed than on the battlefield
of Novara, showed that he was as great a statesman
as he was a leader of his people.</p>

<p>Cavour thought of plunging into battle in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
hope of being killed, he thought of joining Mazzini
in extreme revolutionary measures, but meanwhile
until a new ministry could be formed he was
compelled to continue his government at Turin.
It became his duty to notify the commissioners he
had appointed for Florence, Parma, and Modena
to abandon those charges, and he did so, but wrote
them privately to stay where they were. Farini
wrote him from Modena that he should treat the
returning Duke as an enemy of Italy, and Cavour
replied, &ldquo;The Minister is dead; the friend applauds
your decision.&rdquo; He had thrown off his old
mask of diplomacy and become for the moment
one with the revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Succeeded by Rattazzi as Prime Minister, Cavour
went to stay for a short period of rest with
his relatives in Switzerland. He expected to see
Napoleon seize Savoy and Nice, although he had
not performed his part in the Pact of Plombi√®res.
Again Napoleon surprised him, he returned to
Paris without pressing any claim to new territory.
Meanwhile the people of central Italy were asking
for union with Piedmont, and all the Powers were
much concerned with their disposition, particularly
England, which under the ministry of Lord Palmerston,
an old and warm friend of Cavour, was
now commencing openly to champion Italian independence.
Palmerston did not trust Napoleon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
regretted that the only Italian statesman whom he
considered able to cope with the French was out
of office. The British Premier wrote at this time,
&ldquo;They talk a great deal in Paris of Cavour&rsquo;s intrigues.
This seems to me unjust. If they mean
that he has worked for the aggrandisement and
for the emancipation of Italy from foreign yoke
and Austrian domination, this is true, and he will
be called a patriot in history. The means he has
employed may be good or bad. I do not know
what they have been, but the object in view is, I
am sure, the good of Italy. The people of the
Duchies have as much right to change their sovereigns
as the English people, or the French, or
the Belgian, or the Swedish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Napoleon still had five divisions of his army in
Lombardy and his attitude toward the annexation
of the central states was most important. No
one knew exactly what that attitude was. He told
the Piedmontese that he could not allow the union
of Tuscany, but at the same time he told Austrian
and Papal sympathizers that he was too deeply
attached to the principle of Italian independence
to allow him to make war on the nationalists.
Rattazzi did not know which course to adopt, although
the King was quite willing to risk everything
in succoring Tuscany. Then Napoleon
suddenly proposed another of his Paris Congresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to settle the difficulty, and Piedmont turned to
Cavour to speak its claims.</p>

<p>The Congress never met, but Cavour&rsquo;s appointment
as envoy and the zealous support of the English
government caused the downfall of the ministry,
and in January, 1860, Cavour again took
command of the state. His policy now was plain,
&ldquo;Let the people of central Italy declare themselves
what they want,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we will
stand by their decisions, come what may.&rdquo; The
people of central Italy wanted union and Cavour
turned again to see what Napoleon would do.
What he would do was gradually becoming plainer.
He would only sell his assent to the annexation of
the states in return for Savoy and Nice. They
were the old stakes of the Pact of Plombi√®res, and
Cavour had to decide whether they should go.</p>

<p>His decision to sacrifice Savoy and Nice for the
peaceful annexation of central Italy has been
the most bitterly criticised act in Cavour&rsquo;s life. It
can never be determined whether the sacrifice was
absolutely essential, or whether in time Italy might
not have been united without that step. In that
day the judgment of the best-informed was that
Napoleon would have sent his army into Tuscany
unless his desire was met. Cavour had only agreed
to consider the sacrifice at Plombi√®res because he
was willing to go to any length to secure Italy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
from foreign domination. He was willing to pay
the same price now although he realized what the
cost would be to his name. The King had given
his daughter as the price of the French alliance.
He sadly agreed to the further sacrifice. Both
Victor Emmanuel and Cavour were looking towards
their ultimate goal.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous responsibility. Napoleon
insisted that the treaty should be secret and should
not be submitted to the Piedmont Parliament. He
knew that England would be indignant when the
news became known. So Cavour was forced to
keep the decision secret and to prepare to shoulder
by himself all the wrath of his people. On March
24, 1860, after hours of consideration, Cavour
signed. Then he prepared to summon a Parliament
which might as he foresaw indict him on a
charge of high treason for his unconstitutional
act.</p>

<p>The Parliament which for the first time represented
Piedmont, Lombardy, Parma, Modena, and
Romagna, met on April 2. Guerrazzi made a most
bitter attack on the ministry, in which he likened
Cavour to the Earl of Clarendon under Charles the
Second, &ldquo;hard towards the King, truculent to
Parliament, who thought in his pride that he could
do anything.&rdquo; Cavour replied with a stinging
description of the men with whom he had had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
contend, and avowed his complete responsibility
for the treaty. A large majority of the Parliament
voted with him, but it was a severe test of his
power and popularity. Garibaldi, born in Nice,
never forgave him, many of his countrymen considered
his act absolutely unwarrantable, a monstrous
piece of base ingratitude; he himself knew
the price he had paid only too well, but he believed
that it was a price he was forced to pay if
Italy were ever to be free.</p>

<p>The next step in the dramatic history followed
almost immediately, and although it took place
without the open approval of Cavour there is no
question but that he was secretly hoping for its
success. The King of Naples and Sicily was in
hard straits, his people were now continually
fomenting revolutions, Austria no longer came to
his aid as she had formerly. The feeling throughout
Europe was so general that Francis II. stood
on the edge of the precipice that on April 15
Victor Emmanuel wrote him and told him that his
only hope of safety lay in granting his subjects
an immediate constitution. Francis, like a true
Bourbon, postponed action until it was too late.
Meantime northern revolutionists were waking to
the idea of sending an expedition south to free
Sicily, and Garibaldi&rsquo;s name was on every tongue.
Cavour did not wish Garibaldi to go, he knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
tremendous odds against his succeeding, and he
realized that in case of success serious difficulties
must at once arise. He was tempted to keep Garibaldi
at home by force, but the King would not
listen to such action. On May 5 Garibaldi and
his famous Legion sailed from Quarto, and with
their sailing an accomplished fact Cavour gave
them such help as he could.</p>

<p>Good fortune tended on Garibaldi and the
Thousand, they made their landing on the Sicilian
coast and swept the royal troops before them. The
English fleet did not actually aid them, but were
not sorry for their happy progress. The rest of
the world looked on and wondered if this sudden
attack on southern Italy was another of Cavour&rsquo;s
coups. Most observers considered that it was.
The King of Naples said that Garibaldi was a
blind; behind him was ranged Piedmont, intent
on the fall of his dynasty.</p>

<p>Garibaldi was hailed at Palermo as dictator
and his victory over Sicily was complete. He had
always acted in Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s name, but
Cavour feared that his followers were too deeply
imbued with Mazzini&rsquo;s republican ideas to be eager
to join with Piedmont. He was mistaken, he did
not then altogether understand Garibaldi, and he
never did entire justice to Mazzini&rsquo;s principles.</p>

<p>If the European Powers had protested, Gari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>baldi
could not have crossed to the mainland, but
England would not accept Napoleon&rsquo;s proposal to
intervene, and Naples was left to itself. Cavour
understood that the Kingdom of Francis must fall,
and only hoped that it might be by diplomacy
rather than at the hands of Garibaldi&rsquo;s troops.
His plans to this end failed, Garibaldi reached
Calabria and began his triumphal march to Naples.
He had become a name with which to conjure
all classes of the people, victory over every
evil must follow his footsteps, the Kingdom of
Naples, wretchedly weak, fell before him. Garibaldi
became a hero throughout Europe, it was
now Cavour&rsquo;s task to treat diplomatically with
such a victorious force.</p>

<p>In order that Garibaldi might not attempt to
sweep north through Papal territory Cavour determined
to send the army of northern Italy down
into Umbria and the Marches of Ancona. It was
a direct defiance of the temporal power of the
Pope, but all discerning men had seen that the step
must soon come. Moreover it was the desire now
of practically all Italy to be united, the flood had
swept so far that they would be content with nothing
but the whole peninsula. Again Europe made
no effectual protest, Napoleon was as usual undetermined,
Lord Palmerston eager for Italy&rsquo;s success.
Ancona fell, and Victor Emmanuel marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
on into Neapolitan territory, delivering the last
central provinces from Austrian influence. The
Austrian government did not declare war, perhaps
they realized at last that the world was
moving forward, not backward, and that they had
had their day.</p>

<p>Garibaldi&rsquo;s last victory occurred on the Volturno
on October 1. The royal forces and the victorious
Legion had practically met. Cavour was
strongly tempted to declare Victor Emmanuel dictator,
but his belief in constitutional methods triumphed.
He would not bedim one ray of Garibaldi&rsquo;s
glory, but he wanted to cement the constitutional
monarchy. Disputes arose between the
royal generals and the revolutionists, Cavour insisted
that the Garibaldian troops should be honorably
treated. He knew that Garibaldi had not
forgiven him for the sacrifice of Nice, but he could
place higher his own admiration for the hero.
&ldquo;Garibaldi,&rdquo; he wrote to the King, &ldquo;has become
my most violent enemy, but I desire for the good of
Italy, and the honor of your Majesty, that he
should retire entirely satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tremendous popular influences were at work to
have a dictator appointed to govern southern
Italy for at least a year. Cavour might have consented
to the popular acclaim for Garibaldi, or
have compelled the appointment of one of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
party. He did neither, instead he appealed to the
Parliament. He introduced a bill authorizing the
Government to accept the immediate annexation of
such provinces of central and southern Italy as
expressed by universal suffrage their desire to become
a part of the constitutional Kingdom of
Victor Emmanuel. Parliament passed this bill on
October 11. It was still in doubt whether the
Garibaldians would agree. On October 13 Garibaldi
called his followers together, and declared
that if the people voted for annexation they should
have it. Then he issued the order that &ldquo;the two
Sicilies form an integral part of Italy, one and
indivisible under the constitutional King, Victor
Emmanuel, and his successors.&rdquo; He had made
the King a present of his conquests. It is probable
that Cavour had truly estimated Garibaldi&rsquo;s
depths of patriotism.</p>

<p>Napoleon still kept his troops at Gaeta, but was
finally brought to see that the conflict could only
end in the one way. The French fleet withdrew,
and the city surrendered February 13, 1861.
Francis II. went into exile. Rome still held out,
but Cavour was determined that the Pope&rsquo;s temporal
power must end and that city become the
capital of the new kingdom. A general election
to the new Parliament took place, and the returns
showed a large majority pledged to Cavour&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
views. When the new Chamber met their first act
was to vote Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s assumption of the
title of King of Italy. It had been proposed by
some that the title be King of the Italians, but
Cavour insisted that only King of Italy spoke of
the accomplished fact of the new nation.</p>

<p>On March 25, 1861, Cavour stated in Parliament
that Italy must have Rome as its capital, but
on the distinct understanding that this act should
in no sense denote the servitude of the Church. He
proclaimed a free church in a free state as the
solution of the historic problem, events had shown
that a power which could only be sustained by
means of foreign support was not destined to last.
Parliament voted for Rome as the capital, and
Cavour opened negotiations with the Vatican. He
found argument there vain, and turned to France
in the hope of securing an ally who could conciliate
the Pope. Meanwhile he was busied with the
disposition of Garibaldi&rsquo;s troops, which were persistently
disregarded by the regular army. Garibaldi
was indignant and stated in Parliament that
Cavour was &ldquo;driving the country into civil war.&rdquo;
Cavour, stung by the words, nevertheless held his
peace and replied calmly. The breach between the
two men was made up, they met as friends a little
later at the King&rsquo;s desire.</p>

<p>In May, 1861, it was seen that Cavour was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
ailing, he had worked too hard and given himself
no chance to rest. The last day he sat in Parliament
he fell ill with fever, and from that he never
recovered. Unto the very end he was deep in plans
for the new nation; on June 6 he died.</p>

<p>The tale of the birth of the Italian nation reads
like a romance, barrier after barrier, seemingly
insurmountable, fell at the touch of a wand, and
the wand was ever in Cavour&rsquo;s hand. Mazzini had
breathed a new hope into Italy, Victor Emmanuel
had given a noble leader to the cause, Garibaldi
had fought and conquered, but it was Cavour who
had so fused their efforts that they led to the single
goal. He was always the Italian first, the Minister
of Piedmont afterwards. In history he will
figure as a great patriot, in his lifetime he
was recognized throughout Europe as the great
statesman.</p>

<p>It is reported that Metternich in his old age
said, &ldquo;There is only one diplomatist in Europe,
but he is against us; it is M. de Cavour.&rdquo; Palmerston
always recognized him as the one man who
could unite his country and foil Napoleon, Bismarck
studied him as a pattern for his own later
efforts, and Napoleon, his lifelong ally and opponent,
conceded that Cavour alone impressed him
as a genius of the first rank in statecraft. His
contemporaries could not always understand him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
he had so often to give up the immediate advantage
for the future gain, he had to wear his mask
so frequently even among his own people that men
grew to believe he preferred the circuitous to the
straight path. From the vantage point of a later
day it is possible to see how frail was the skiff he
navigated and how perilous the seas. It was so
easy for the Powers of Europe, secure themselves,
to prefer peace to any fresh disturbance. What
did the welfare of a few small states matter to
them? Italy was chronically misgoverned. Cavour
had to take each forward step in fear that he
might call down upon Piedmont the avalanche of
Europe; his one ally, the French Emperor, was as
stable as quicksilver, never two days the same. It
almost passes belief that Cavour did manage to
sail his skiff into port, he could only have done it
by alternate patience and audacity.</p>

<p>Cavour did not live to see Rome or Venice become
part of the Kingdom, but it was his work
that made those later triumphs possible. He had
foreseen their coming, he had a genius for foresight,
even in the early days when he seemed speaking
only for Piedmont he was planning for Italy.
But in his planning for the great goal he never
forgot to make certain of each step, his diplomacy
was a logical sequence of accepted opportunities,
he believed in taking the straight path if that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
were possible, if not in circling the obstacle that
blocked his way.</p>

<p>The story is told that when the wife of the Russian
Minister at Turin was shopping in that city
the clerk suddenly left her and ran to the door.
When he returned he said, &ldquo;I saw Count Cavour
passing, and wishing to know how our affairs are
going on, I wanted to see how he looked. He looks
in good spirits, so everything is going right.&rdquo; The
story illustrates how, after Cavour had once taken
the helm, the people of Piedmont trusted him,
growing more and more confident that he would
lead them aright although they could not always
see the logic of his steps. Few statesmen have received
more complete allegiance from a people than
Cavour ultimately won, but no statesman ever deserved
the gratitude of his countrymen more unreservedly.</p>

<h2><a name="GARIBALDI_THE_CRUSADER" id="GARIBALDI_THE_CRUSADER">GARIBALDI, THE CRUSADER</a></h2>


<p class="start-chap"><span class="smcap">When</span> Mazzini had stirred men&rsquo;s minds to
fever-heat in the great cause of Italian liberty,
and Cavour had so manipulated events that
political progress was possible, came Garibaldi, to
lead with all the fire of a crusader the new race
of Italian patriots. He was a hero of legends as
soon as he took the field. He cannot be compared
to any modern general, nor his army to any other
army of recent centuries; he was the personal hero
whose red shirt and slouch hat became symbols
of liberty, and whose name was sufficient to work
miracles of faith. Many a Calabrian peasant confidently
expected the millennium to follow in Garibaldi&rsquo;s
footsteps, and this faith, spreading as all
great popular emotions do, swept him and his
ragged volunteers to victory after victory that a
less legendary but vastly more experienced general
never would have known. He was always the pure-hearted
crusader with the single goal.</p>

<p>Giuseppe Garibaldi was born in Nice in the year
1807, two years the junior of Mazzini, three years
the senior of Cavour. His parents, who were in
very modest circumstances, wished him to enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
priesthood, but his nature was too adventurous to
suit him for the religious life. Even as a boy he
craved action and wanted to share his father&rsquo;s life
on the sea. Father and grandfather had been
sailors, and the boy Giuseppe could not be kept
from boats. Realizing this inheritance, the father
took him with him on his voyages. His second
voyage was made to Rome, and the sight of that
city stirred the boy to the foundations of his nature.
Years later he wrote of this first boyhood
impression, &ldquo;Rome, which I had before admired
and thought of frequently, I ever since have loved.
It has been dear to me beyond all things. I not
only admired her for her former power and the
remains of antiquity, but even the smallest thing
connected with her was precious to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very early, on a voyage to Russia, a young
Ligurian mate told the youth something of the
plans of the scattered Italian patriots, and, once
conscious that there was a movement on foot to
liberate his beloved country, Garibaldi sought all
people and writings which could enlighten him on
that score. Thus he came almost immediately under
the influence of Mazzini&rsquo;s work and joined his
new movement of &ldquo;Young Italy.&rdquo; From the moment
of this association his life held the single purpose,
he was ready to make any sacrifice in this
cause. In 1834 he joined in the ill-fated expedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>tion
to Savoy, and as a consequence found himself
on February 5, of that year, flying from Genoa as
a proscript. A few days later he learned from
a newspaper that he had been condemned to death
by the government. Shortly afterwards he sailed
from Marseilles for Brazil.</p>

<p>For the next fourteen years Garibaldi led the
life of a guerilla leader, fighting the battles of
Montevideo, and taking a chief part in the innumerable
wars for independence which served to
keep the South American states in constant upheaval
during the first half of the Nineteenth Century.
The various states were full of French,
Spanish, and Italian adventurers, and Garibaldi
contrived, with that intuitive insight into character
which was one of the chief characteristics of his
genius, to choose certain of the Italians who were
as intense partisans of liberty as he, and form
them into a legion, destined to be the nucleus of
that famous Italian &ldquo;Legion&rdquo; which was later to
win its victories on the other side of the world. The
South American adventures of the young general
read like a story from the romantic pages of a
novelist, they are a perpetual record of battles,
sieges, and alarms. Through their turbulent
course Garibaldi learned experience of rough, irregular
fighting, which was later to prove invaluable.
To add to the romance of these years Gari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>baldi
met at a small town in the district of Laguna,
in Brazil, the woman who so charmed him
at first sight that he immediately wooed her and
won her for his wife, the dearly beloved Anita who
accompanied him afterwards on all his military
expeditions, both by land and sea, and proved herself
the equal of any of his men in devotion and
the most intrepid courage in the face of extreme
peril.</p>

<p>In 1847 Pius IX., the new Pontiff, stirred all
Italian patriots with the brave words he uttered
in behalf of a new and free Italy. To men who
had waited long for a leader who should unite all
the small states the Pope appeared as a real deliverer,
and for a few short months he did indeed
stand at the head of a movement closely allied to
the Guelphic policies of the Middle Ages. The
news of the Pope&rsquo;s call to all Italians reached
Garibaldi and his friends in Montevideo, and immediately
the former and his friend, Colonel Anzani,
wrote to Pius IX. tendering him their allegiance,
and offering the assistance of their swords.
Lines throughout the letter show the self-abnegating,
single-hearted devotion of Garibaldi to
Italy&rsquo;s cause, the one sacred service of his life.
&ldquo;If then to-day our arms, which are not strangers
to fighting, are acceptable to your Holiness, we
need not say how willingly we shall offer them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the service of one who has done so much for our
country and our church. We shall count ourselves
happy if we can but come to aid Pius IX.
in his work of redemption.... We shall consider
ourselves privileged if we are allowed to show our
devotedness by offering our blood.&rdquo; Unfortunately
the Pope was not made of the same heroic
fiber as the South American soldier. No answer
was made to the letter, but Garibaldi was so eager
to be on the scene of action and learn conditions
for himself that he immediately sailed, although
still under sentence of death, for Italy with fifty
members of his Legion.</p>

<p>They landed at Nice on June 24, 1848. Already
they had learned at Alicante the stirring
events of that memorable spring, and were burning
to take the field against the Austrians. The
leader and his handful of men hastened to Lombardy
to offer their services to the Sardinian King,
Charles Albert. The King received the offer very
coldly, but, his ardor undaunted, Garibaldi pushed
on to Milan. The latter city had learned of his
many battles in South America and hailed him
with great enthusiasm. From the country volunteers
came pouring to his standard, and in an incredibly
short time at least 30,000 men had joined
the remnant of the legion. They were most of
them wild with the desire to drive the Austrians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
from Lombardy. Charles Albert was defeated
and signed an armistice by which Milan was given
back to the Empire, but the Garibaldian army
paid no heed to the formal terms of peace, and
continued a guerilla warfare wherever white-coated
Austrians were to be found.</p>

<p>An eye-witness, Giulio Dandolo, thus describes
the appearance of Garibaldi&rsquo;s troops: &ldquo;Picture
to yourself,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;an incongruous assemblage
of individuals of all descriptions, boys of
twelve or fourteen, veteran soldiers attracted by
the fame of the celebrated chieftain of Montevideo,
some stimulated by ambition, others seeking for
impunity and license in the confusion of war, yet
so restrained by the inflexible severity of their
leader that courage and daring alone could find a
vent, whilst more lawless passions were curbed beneath
his will. The general and his staff all rode
on American saddles, wore scarlet blouses, with
hats of every possible form, without distinction of
any kind, or pretension to military ornament....
Garibaldi, if the encampment was far from the
scene of danger, would stretch himself under his
tent; if on the contrary the enemy were near at
hand he remained constantly on horseback giving
orders and visiting the outposts. Often disguised
as a peasant, he risked his own safety in daring
reconnaissances, but most frequently, seated on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
some commanding elevation, he would pass whole
hours examining the surrounding country with his
telescope. When the general&rsquo;s trumpet gave the
signal to prepare for departure lassoes secured the
horses which had been left to graze in the meadows.
The order of march was always arranged
on the preceding day, and the corps set out without
so much as knowing where the evening would
find them. Owing to this patriarchal simplicity,
pushed sometimes too far, Garibaldi appeared
more like the chief of a tribe of Indians than a
general, but at the approach of danger and in the
heat of combat, his presence of mind was admirable;
and then by the astonishing rapidity of his
movements he made up in a great measure for his
deficiency in those qualities which are generally
supposed to be absolutely essential to a military
commander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speed and audacity constituted the two main
elements of the leader&rsquo;s tactics. One day when
on Lake Maggiore Garibaldi managed to take
two Austrian steamers by surprise, and placing
1500 men upon them, suddenly appeared at Luino.
From there he planned an attack on 10,000 Austrians
encamped nearby, but news of his intentions
reached the enemy, and he was obliged to
scatter his small force in a skilfully contrived retreat.
The actual result of such a campaign was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
small, but the extreme skill of his sudden advances
and retreats won him a European prestige as a
master of light warfare, and continually brought
soldiers to his standard. When the regular armies
ceased fighting ardent patriots turned to Garibaldi
as the last remaining hope.</p>

<p>While in Switzerland he was seized with marsh
fever and became dangerously ill. When he recovered
he joined his family at Nice and there
spent the autumn. Charles Albert had by now
repented his cold treatment of the young man&rsquo;s offer
of service and tendered him a high rank in
the Sardinian army. Garibaldi, however, wished
more immediate action than such a position offered,
and had moreover been fired with hope at
the reports of Daniel Manin&rsquo;s heroic defense of
Venice against the Austrians. He determined to
go to Venice, and started with two hundred and
fifty volunteer companions. At Ravenna he
learned of the revolution at Rome, and then, as
always in his life, could not resist the call of
the Eternal City. He changed his course towards
Rome, and as he traveled his followers increased
to 1500 men. With this band he approached
the city, which had been deserted by
that Pope of noble impulses but timid resolution to
whom Garibaldi had written offering his services
the previous year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Pius IX. executed a complete volte-face. Terrified
at the assassination of his Prime Minister
Rossi, and worked on by his clerical ministers of
State and foreign diplomatists, he withdrew the
liberal concessions he had just granted his Roman
subjects, declared the notoriously vicious King
Bomba of Naples a model monarch and fled to
Gaeta, leaving Rome to the revolutionists. At
the same time Mazzini the arch idealist appeared
among them, and he and Garibaldi, both hailed as
pre-eminent leaders in their respective fields, were
elected members of the new Roman Assembly.
Mazzini was in charge of the civil government,
Garibaldi of the army now rapidly gathering from
all parts of Italy. He took his position on
the frontier menaced by the Neapolitan army, and
fortified the stronghold of Rieti.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in northern Italy Charles Albert had
again taken the field, had lost the battle of
Novara, and had abdicated. The Roman Republic
immediately found itself beset by great European
Powers, Austria, Spain, and Naples, eager
to restore the Pontiff and teach his audacious subjects
a salutary lesson. As Manin in Venice, so
Mazzini in Rome looked to France for succor, or
at least to uphold the policy of non-intervention.
Did not the constitution of the then existing
French Republic specifically state that that nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
&ldquo;would never employ her arms against the liberty
of any people&rdquo;? Acting on this assumption the
Roman Assembly voted for the perpetual abolition
of the temporal power of the Pope, and on April
18, 1849, addressed a manifesto to the governments
of England and France, setting forth
&ldquo;that the Roman people had the right to give
themselves the form of government which pleased
them, that they had sanctioned the independence
and free exercise of the spiritual authority of the
Pope, and that they trusted that England and
France would not assist in restoring a government
irreconcilable by its nature with liberty and
civilization, and morally destitute of all authority
for many years past, and materially so during the
previous five months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Louis Napoleon, president of the
French Republic, sent an army under General
Oudinot to Civita Vecchia, declaring that his purpose
was simply to maintain order. The Triumvirs,
Mazzini, Armellini, and Saffi, thought it
wisest to prepare Rome for possible defense, and
called Garibaldi from the Neapolitan frontier.
The Roman Republic hailed him as its defender.
&ldquo;This mysterious conqueror,&rdquo; says Miraglia,
&ldquo;surrounded by a brilliant halo of glory, who entered
Rome on the eve of the very day on which
the Republic was about to be attacked, was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
minds of the Roman people the only man capable
of maintaining the &lsquo;decree of resistance;&rsquo; therefore
the multitudes on the very instant united
themselves with the man who personified the wants
of the moment and who was the hope of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>April 30 was the date of the first French attack,
an assault so violently resisted that 7000
picked troops were disastrously routed by a much
smaller number of Garibaldi&rsquo;s volunteers. Oudinot
was amazed, and sought an armistice, while
Louis Napoleon, in order to hurry re-enforcements
to Civita Vecchia, sent De Lesseps to open negotiations
for peace. Garibaldi desired no armistice,
he feared delay, but the Triumvirs still hoped
to obtain France&rsquo;s assistance ultimately and so
checked his pursuing the first advantage. It was
a contest between the principles of diplomacy and
warfare.</p>

<p>The negotiations with the French envoy
dragged, but meanwhile Garibaldi was not idle.
On May 4, with 4000 light troops, he secretly left
Rome. On the 8th they reached Palestrina, and
on the following day met the Neapolitan army,
some 7000 strong. Three hours of fighting put
the latter troops to ignominious flight. Later
their general attributed the overwhelming defeat
to the superstitious terror inspired in his men by
the very name of Garibaldi, and the remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
appearance of his red-shirted troops. They were
convinced that Garibaldi was the devil, for they
found that even holy silver bullets failed to strike
him down.</p>

<p>Fearing lest the French might attack Rome in
his absence Garibaldi now returned there, making
a rapid retreat and passing within two miles of
the enemy. De Lesseps and the Triumvirs were
still conferring. Then for some unaccountable
reason a Colonel Roselli was placed over Garibaldi&rsquo;s
head, and the famous commander, probably
the victim of malicious envy, was only second
in command. He did not complain. &ldquo;Some of
my friends,&rdquo; he wrote characteristically, &ldquo;urged
me not to accept a secondary position, under a
man who, only the day before, was my inferior, but
I confess these questions of self-love never yet
troubled me; whoever gives me a chance of fighting,
if only as a common soldier, against the
enemy of my country, him will I thank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The army of King Bomba now rallied, and took
certain strongholds on the road to Rome. Garibaldi
was sent out to dislodge them, and met and
put to flight a large Neapolitan column near Velletri.
The latter took refuge in that city, but
when the Roman volunteers made a reconnaissance
of the place in the morning they found the army
had fled panic-stricken during the night. Again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the name of Garibaldi and the magic of his red
shirt, or famous &ldquo;camicia rossa,&rdquo; had been too
much for them. The only credit the Neapolitan
general could contrive to take to himself was a
statement in the official report of the extraordinary
rapidity and safety of his retreat.</p>

<p>A few days later General Roselli ordered Garibaldi
to carry the war into Neapolitan territory,
and he had proceeded along the ancient Samnite
road as far as the banks of the Volturno when
messengers called him in all haste back to Rome to
be present at the final negotiations with the
French. He returned to Rome on May 24, to be
hailed again as the invincible defender of the
Republic.</p>

<p>The French Commissioner De Lesseps signed
certain agreements with the Roman Assembly and
then referred these agreements to General Oudinot
for ratification. The General, however, had
by this time received his long-desired re-enforcements,
and, stating that De Lesseps had exceeded
his authority, prepared for an immediate attack.
He said, however, that he would postpone the
actual assault until Monday, June 4, but did
actually commence operations on Sunday the 3d,
taking the Romans off their guard and capturing
the outposts and the Ponte Molle.</p>

<p>So soon as the treacherous attack was known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the bells of the Capitol gave the alarm, and Garibaldi&rsquo;s
Legion, together with the Lombard volunteers,
rushed to the defense. The fighting in the
entire circuit of the city&rsquo;s walls was desperate,
but the soldiers of the Legion were no longer opposed
to Austrians or superstitious Neapolitans,
but to veteran French troops, so numerous that
losses meant little to them. Nevertheless the city
held out while De Lesseps pleaded for the terms
of his agreement at Paris. Garibaldi tried every
device to dislodge the French batteries which were
shattering the Roman walls, but all to no avail.
It was clear that the siege would be only a matter
of days before news came that the French government
disavowed any part in the agreement
signed by De Lesseps. Mazzini still urged resistance
to the end, but the disparity in forces was
so overwhelming that Garibaldi could not agree
with him. This difference of opinion tended to
widen still further the gulf which already existed
between the theorist and the soldier.</p>

<p>On June 21 the French succeeded in planting
a battery within the city walls, and from that time
the work of destruction progressed more rapidly.
The defense was intensely dramatic, demagogues
mixing with the purest natured patriots, the popular
orator Ciceruacchio, with bloody shirt and
sword, pouring forth his burning words on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
spirit of ancient Roman independence, Ugo Bassi,
the monk, going about among the dying, holding
the crucifix before their eyes, utterly regardless
of the storm of bullets all around him. It was a
noble defense, but it could have only one end, and
so finally on June 30, at the advice of Garibaldi,
who appeared before the Triumvirs, his clothing
shot into ribbons, the Government issued the order
that &ldquo;The Roman Republic in the name of God
and the people gives up a defense which has become
impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On that same day the Triumvirs resigned, and
the Assembly appointed Garibaldi dictator. For
a few days negotiations looking to an armistice
were conducted between the French and the Roman
lines. Finally, on July 3, the negotiations came
to an end. Garibaldi called the troops into the
great square before St. Peter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Soldiers!&rdquo; he
declared, &ldquo;that which I have to offer you is this;
hunger, thirst, cold, heat; no pay, no barracks,
no rations, but frequent alarms, forced marches,
charges at the point of the bayonet. Whoever
loves our country and glory may follow me!&rdquo;
About four thousand men instantly volunteered,
and at almost the same hour when the French entered
the city the little Legion left, taking the
road to Tivoli, with the purpose of gaining the
broken Tuscan mountain country. The leader&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
devoted wife Anita went with him, as patiently
his companion in adventures in Italy as in her
native South America.</p>

<p>The Papal banner was flung from the Castle
of St. Angelo, and the Roman Republic came to
an end. Its story is almost as eventful, almost
as heroic as Manin&rsquo;s defense of the Venetian Republic
during practically the same time. In both
cases the cities fell, but as Manin at Venice so
Mazzini and Garibaldi at Rome had taught their
people that they were capable of the greatest sacrifices
in the cause of that liberty of which all
Italy was dreaming.</p>

<p>Long pages would be needed to tell of the excitements
and dangers which befell Garibaldi and
his army as they threaded their way northward,
their ultimate destination Venice, which had not
yet surrendered. The French and Austrians were
always at their heels, and the troop must inevitably
have been captured but for the masterly
skill of the general in such guerilla warfare.
Swift night marches, daytime lying in wait,
sudden attacks and equally sudden retreats,
served to carry them gradually away from Rome.
They left Orvieto one hour before the French
troops entered. Thence the route lay by Arezzo
and Montepulciano to the little republic of San
Marino, close to Rimini. By this time the army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
was sadly reduced in size and strength, the Austrians
were pressing close upon their heels, and
Garibaldi saw that escape could only lie in scattering
his men. He released all the volunteers,
bidding them farewell, reminding them that it was
better to die than to live as slaves to the foreigner.</p>

<p>The Austrians threatened an immediate attack
on San Marino, and Garibaldi with a few companions
fled secretly at night. Anita, although
utterly worn out by illness, would not leave him.
The little band reached the port of Cesenatico
and embarked on the Adriatic in thirteen small
boats. The Austrian fire forced nine of the boats
to surrender, the remaining four, in one of which
was the general, his wife, Ciceruacchio, the
Roman orator, and the priest Ugo Bassi, succeeded
in escaping and landing near the mouth
of the Po.</p>

<p>The fugitives had barely landed when they
were surrounded by Austrian scouts. Anita became
desperately ill, and was forced to hide with
her husband in a cornfield, an old comrade of
Garibaldi&rsquo;s in South America keeping watch over
them. The general was beside himself with grief
as he tended his rapidly failing wife. Ugo Bassi,
afraid to stay with them lest his presence should
lead to their discovery, was shortly captured by
Austrians, and Ciceruacchio and the nine others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
were soon after taken prisoners. All but the orator
and the priest were immediately shot. Bassi
and Ciceruacchio were taken to Bologna, and
there ordered executed by Bedini, the Papal Legate,
a man of infamous memory, who commanded
that Bassi be tortured before execution. The
heroic priest must always stand forth as one of
the rarest martyr-spirits produced by the great
struggle for Italian liberty.</p>

<p>Garibaldi succeeded in finding some kind-hearted
peasants who carried Anita to a cottage.
Not long after she reached its shelter she died.
The general, broken-hearted, was forced by the
approach of Austrian soldiers to go to Ravenna,
thence in disguise he went to Florence and
finally to Genoa. Here he visited his mother and
his three children, who had been left by Anita
with their grandmother. His presence in Genoa
was an embarrassment to the Government at
Turin, and they courteously asked him to leave
Italy. Instead of doing so he went to Sardinia,
much to the uneasiness of the French, who wished
him farther away. In this mountain island he
lived a life, half that of a hermit, and half of a
bandit, continually hunted as an outlaw, and finding
entire safety only on the small island rock of
Caprera. This tiny island, destined to become
famous as his home, abounded in natural beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of a wild and desolate type, and made a deep impression
on the refugee, whose mind was always
peculiarly open to the spell of majestic scenery.</p>

<p>Finally, to the great relief of both France and
Piedmont, Garibaldi was induced to leave Sardinian
territory. He went to Gibraltar, but was only
allowed to stay twenty-four hours. No European
country was anxious to harbor a man whose name
had become a watchword for revolutionary zeal.
Finding this to be the case the general sailed for
New York, and spent about a year and a half
engaged in making tallow candles in a small back
street. He was not alone in his exile, the disturbing
years of 1848 and 1849 had sent many a
revolutionary exile across the seas, and at one time
in New York Lamartine, Louis Blanc, Ledru Rollin,
and three or four others almost equally prominent
were supporting themselves there by manual
labor.</p>

<p>When he left New York Garibaldi went again
to South America, and became captain of a merchant
vessel trading between Peru and Hong
Kong. Again he returned to New York and commanded
a trader flying the American flag but
sailed by Italians, who like himself were awaiting
a new tide in affairs before returning home. The
many ups and downs of these roving years
abounded with adventures, but even here Gari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>baldi&rsquo;s
life was no more thrilling than when he
was at the head of his irregular troops in Italy.</p>

<p>After four years of wandering he returned to
Genoa, stopping for a short stay at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
where he was enthusiastically greeted by
English admirers, and given a presentation
sword. When he reached Genoa he found that
his mother had died, and that his three children
were living with his cousins. A few short trips at
sea succeeded in earning him sufficient money to
buy part of the little island of Caprera, of which
he was so fond. Here he established himself to
await events. Europe had grown more peaceful,
but Garibaldi, hot-headed as he was, could see
that Piedmont was slowly but surely widening the
breach between herself and Austria. He began
to look to Piedmont as the hope of Italy, and little
by little to understand, especially when the small
kingdom allied itself with France and England
against Russia, that Piedmont meant Cavour, and
that the latter was the match of any diplomatic
strategist in Europe.</p>

<p>Garibaldi purchased half of the island of Caprera
in 1855, and immediately took possession.
Working with his own hands he built first a log
hut and then a more pretentious villa, to which
in time he brought his cousins, the Deideris, and
his children, Theresita, who was rapidly becom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>ing
a very beautiful girl, and the boys Menotti
and Ricciotti. The general called himself the
&ldquo;recluse of Caprera,&rdquo; and worked hard to cultivate
a soil naturally barren and difficult. He was
glad of the opportunity to rest after so many
years of stirring action, and day by day grew
more enamoured of the wild vegetation of his
island home and the steep cliffs that bordered it
against the sea. Often he had visitors from nearby
Sardinia, simple enthusiastic folk who were
delighted to look upon him as a national hero, and
confidently expected that some day he would lead
an Italian army to the greatest victories. In such
patriarchal simplicity he spent the years until
1859, hearing from time to time news of Cavour&rsquo;s
policies at Turin, always eager in hope that his
sword might soon be drawn in conjunction with
that of a national army.</p>

<p>Ten years of patient waiting and subtle diplomacy
mark the decade between the siege of Rome
and 1859. In that time Cavour, by the successive
steps of the Crimean War, the Congress of
Paris, and the secret Pact of Plombi√®res, had succeeded
in isolating Austria from the other Powers,
and in allying Louis Napoleon with Piedmont.
His next step was to prepare actively for war,
and with this purpose he called Garibaldi to see
him at Turin. Garibaldi went to the Minister&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
house, dressed in his usual campaign clothes, wearing
a loose red blouse and broad-brimmed hat, and
refused to give his name to the servant. On Cavour&rsquo;s
hearing of the presence of such a disreputable
appearing stranger, he said, &ldquo;Let the poor
devil in, he probably has some petition to ask of
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meeting was most amicable, Cavour asked
Garibaldi to command the new volunteer army
known as the &ldquo;Hunters of the Alps,&rdquo; and Garibaldi
was delighted to accept. Immediately he
began recruiting his forces, and so spontaneous
was the rising throughout northern and central
Italy that by May of that year he was at the
head of three regiments of infantry well-equipped
for instant service. Austria was dismayed, and
demanded that Cavour dismiss the men, but by
what was probably the most fortunate coup in his
whole career Cavour was able to appear willing
to have peace, and yet force Austria to war.
Napoleon stood by Piedmont, and in May, 1859,
the campaign that was to redeem the inglorious
field of Novara commenced.</p>

<p>Garibaldi&rsquo;s great reputation caused friction
between him and the officers of the regular army,
and he who had been used to the greatest freedom
of action found himself seriously hampered by
directions from headquarters. He hailed with de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>light
King Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s permission to separate
from the regular army and fight as he
pleased, accompanied as it was with the King&rsquo;s
remark, &ldquo;Go where you like, do what you like;
I feel only one regret, that I am not able to follow
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The resulting campaign showed the great guerilla
warrior at his best. As with the Neapolitans
in 1849, so with the Croats in 1859, Garibaldi
was credited with superhuman powers. At times
the success attending his sheer effrontery seemed
almost to justify such a conclusion. Time and
again he placed himself in positions so desperate
that it was only his quickness of wit in seizing at
a possible chance that saved him. Had he failed
he would have been rated as a bungler, but as he
succeeded the desperation of each chance served
only to magnify his strategy. He was a remarkable
mathematician, able to estimate all possible
combinations adroitly and quickly, he never despaired,
and never hesitated when he had decided
on a plan. As a result the &ldquo;Hunters of the
Alps,&rdquo; or <i>Garibaldini</i>, as the volunteers were called,
hung on the Austrian troops all through Lombardy
and the Lake country, driving them from
town after town by sudden assaults, continually
tricking much larger forces by clever misrepresentations
of their own strength. Garibaldi en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>tered
Lombard territory and took Varese. After
defeating the Austrians near there in the battle of
Malnate he swept up to Cavallesca, near Como,
and, attacking a much larger force than his own,
drove the enemy through Como towards Monza.
Como received the Hunters with open arms, Garibaldi
telegraphed to Milan, using the Austrian
General&rsquo;s name, and so gained information of the
Allies. Soon afterwards he stationed his advance
guard at the Villa Medici, looking down over lake
after lake, and with a panoramic view of the Alps.
Here the Austrians thought to surround him, but
by means of sending false messages planned to fall
into the enemy&rsquo;s hands, and by taking advantage
of a heavy storm at night, he succeeded in escaping
them and regaining Como.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the regular army was winning victories,
Montebello, Magenta, Solferino, and San
Martino were falling to the glory of French and
Italian arms. The Austrians were steadily being
driven back, Garibaldi left Como and took Bergamo,
then Brescia. As he advanced the men of
the land he crossed joined his army, Brescia set to
work to fortify its walls at his command. He was
ordered to follow the Austrians, and pursued them
to Tre Ponti, which he won, although at such a
cost he was obliged to fall back on the main army.</p>

<p>Napoleon the Third had no intention of winning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
too many victories for Italy, nor of allowing the
Garibaldian troops to gain unseemly power. The
plans of the general were therefore interfered with,
his recruits diverted into other channels, and the
Hunters sent into the passes of the Stelvio on the
pretext of preventing an attack from Germany,
but in reality to prevent Garibaldi from crossing
Lake Garda and gaining the valley of the Adige
and the Veronese mountains. The general obeyed,
and conducted a markedly successful campaign
near Sondrio and Bormio, finding himself in his
true element among the Alps.</p>

<p>Then came the stupefying news that Napoleon
had made the peace of Villafranca. The rage of
the <i>Garibaldini</i> knew no bounds, their general
hurried to Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s camp to tender his
resignation. The King would not accept it.
&ldquo;Italy still requires the legions you command,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;you must remain!&rdquo; Garibaldi returned to
his troops, his hatred for Louis Napoleon more
intense than ever, but convinced that the peace
only marked a short pause in the great forward
movement.</p>

<p>Too much credit cannot be given Victor Emmanuel
for his resolution at this time. Bitterly
disappointed as he must have been at such an
abrupt end to a campaign that had promised to
open Italy from the Alps to the Adriatic, he yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
managed to hide his chagrin, and held Garibaldi,
even as he a little later induced Cavour to resume
the post which he had in a burst of rage resigned.
Fortunately also the formal statement of the
peace-makers that the Princes should be restored
to their thrones in Florence, Modena, and Parma,
and the Pope&rsquo;s legates at Bologna, Ferrara, Forli,
and Ravenna was simply a statement, the people
of those cities had quite different views. They
had tasted of liberty and of the victories of a
national army, and one city after another announced
that it would have no more of its
foreign rulers, that its people wished to become
citizens of Italy and subjects of Victor Emmanuel.
Garibaldi heard this and was convinced that it no
longer lay in the power of his arch enemy, Louis
Napoleon, to keep Italians separated. &ldquo;Whatever
may be the march of existing circumstances,&rdquo;
he said to his men, &ldquo;Italians must neither lay aside
their arms, nor be discouraged. They ought on
the contrary to increase in number in their ranks,
to testify to Europe that, guided by their King,
Victor Emmanuel, they are ready to face again the
vicissitudes of war, whatever they may be. Perhaps
at the moment we least expect it the signal of
alarm may again be sounded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was sent into central Italy, and at Florence,
at Bologna, at Rimini, he had only to appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
have volunteers crowd about him. Napoleon
learned of this and remonstrated to the government
at Turin, which attempted to check the ardor
of its great general, and yet keep him for further
use. It was a time when Cavour&rsquo;s skill was taxed
to the uttermost to avoid a break either with the
French or with the Garibaldians.</p>

<p>The news of Cavour&rsquo;s decision to cede Savoy
and Nice to France, a decision only reached when
it became evident that it was the price Napoleon
demanded for allowing central Italy to unite with
Piedmont, came like a thunder clap to Garibaldi.
Born in Nice he declared that the act made him &ldquo;a
stranger in his own country.&rdquo; He was immediately
returned to Parliament for Nice and bitterly
attacked Cavour&rsquo;s policy in the Chamber. He
spoke at length, claiming that the cession was both
an infraction of the original charter by which
Nice had become a part of the Sardinian kingdom,
and a violation of the fundamental law of nationality.
Cavour, however, carried the Parliament
with him, and Garibaldi left for Nice to take farewell
of it, for he refused to remain there and become
a citizen of France. He was disgusted with
the compromises of diplomacy. &ldquo;I have nothing
to do with men or political parties,&rdquo; he declared,
&ldquo;my country, and nothing but my country, is my
object.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Two other incidents of the campaign of 1859
must be mentioned, the one Garibaldi&rsquo;s visit to
Anita&rsquo;s grave near Ravenna, the scene of those
bitter days immediately after the fall of Rome,
to which he now returned as a conqueror. The
other was his marriage at Como during his fighting
in the Lakes to Giuseppina Raymondi, the
adventurous daughter of the Marquis Raymondi,
who persuaded the general that she was deeply in
love with him, in order that marriage might shield
her sadly tarnished name. Garibaldi would not
hear of the marriage at first, and declared that
since Anita&rsquo;s death his heart was withered. The
Marquis answered, &ldquo;It is with freedom, and with
Italian unity that my daughter is enamoured, and
with you as the embodiment of it in Italy.&rdquo; The
general could not withstand that appeal, and consented
to the marriage. The depths of the treachery
were revealed to him immediately afterwards,
and he left his new wife at once. It was years,
however, before he was granted a divorce from her.</p>

<p>Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi each played an
important part in the next act of the great drama
of Italy, but Garibaldi unquestionably held the
center of the stage. The act was the famous
expedition of the Thousand to Sicily, a performance
foolhardy and rash in the extreme, which was,
however, destined to bring to a speedy fruition the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
long-deferred hopes of all Italians patriots. Mazzini&rsquo;s
part was to prepare the field, he had early
chosen Sicily as a most favorable scene for revolutionary
action, and had sent agents to smuggle
arms into the island, to hold meetings and generally
to arouse the people. Cavour&rsquo;s part was to
play the double game of protesting against the
expedition in the eyes of the Powers, and of aiding
it as best he could secretly. He foresaw the risks
that would beset it, and the even greater risk to
his King of having such a dictator as Garibaldi
win many victories, yet he could not absolutely
prevent a scheme devised in all patriotic fervor.
He gave public orders to the Sardinian admiral to
capture Garibaldi and bring him back, but with
a secret message which the admiral rightly understood
as meaning that Cavour wished no such
event to happen. In much the same manner the
British ambassador at Turin, Sir James Hudson,
and the British fleet in the Mediterranean, although
ostensibly strictly neutral, contrived not
to embarrass Garibaldi, and the fleet even went so
far as to appear inadvertently between the Neapolitan
ships and those that bore the Thousand,
thereby preventing what might have been an untimely
cannonade. Though few in official places
therefore openly countenanced the expedition,
many hoped that it would succeed. Under such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
circumstances the general sailed from Genoa on
May 5, 1860, with some 1067 picked men, many
recruited from the &ldquo;Hunters of the Alps,&rdquo; henceforth
to be known as the &ldquo;Mille,&rdquo; and destined to
make one of the greatest expeditions in history,
and eventually to give two crowns to the house of
Savoy.</p>

<p>It was an historic day when the &ldquo;great filibuster,&rdquo;
as Garibaldi was called, sailed from
Genoa. Parents, wives, and children bade the
Thousand a tearful farewell in the rocky bay of
Quarto, where to-day a marble star upon the cliff
commemorates the event. At Talamone they
landed to seize some arms and to send a force of
one hundred men into the Papal States to incite
rebellion. Then they set sail fairly out to sea, and
Garibaldi and his chiefs planned the Sicilian campaign.
May 11 the two shiploads reached Marsala,
hotly pursued by Neapolitan cruisers. The
Thousand took possession of the town, the general
issued glowing proclamations to the citizens, and
quickly recruited a corps of over a thousand
Sicilian scouts. From Marsala they went to
Salemi, a march triumphantly acclaimed by
monks, priests, women, and children who lined the
roads, and with Sicilian impetuosity were carried
away by the sudden appearance of an Italian
army. At Salemi Garibaldi issued this pronun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>ciamento:
&ldquo;Garibaldi, commander-in-chief of the
national forces in Sicily, on the invitation of the
principal citizens, and on the deliberation of the
free communes of the island, considering that in
time of war it is necessary that the civil and military
power should be united in one person, assumes,
in the name of Victor Emmanuel, King of
Italy, the Dictatorship in Sicily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first battle was fought in the heart of the
mountains, at Calatafimi, where numbers of ancient
ruins gave Garibaldi opportunity to use his skill
in irregular fighting. The battle lasted three
hours, both Garibaldi&rsquo;s son Menotti, and the son
of Daniel Manin of Venice, were wounded; in the
end the conflict was a victory for the Thousand.
The Neapolitans fell back on Palermo, and Garibaldi
planned to take the Sicilian capital.</p>

<p>Throughout the campaign the officers of the
King of Naples showed the same sublime incompetence
which characterized their sovereign. Palermo
should have been easy to defend, and with this
knowledge, and misled by Garibaldi&rsquo;s tactics into
believing him in retreat, the Neapolitan general
gave a great dinner at the capital and proceeded
to forget the war altogether. As a result, by a remarkably
swift march, Garibaldi appeared at the
gates of Palermo, carried them, swept through
street after street of the city, and drove the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
into the castle and palace. For a few days the
city was laid waste by bombs from the two latter
positions, and from the fleet in the harbor, then
the Neapolitan general asked for an armistice,
which eventually ended in the evacuation of Sicily,
except at Messina and a few forts, by the army
of the King of Naples. As most of the soldiers
were Austrians, they left without any deep regret,
in fact with almost as much rejoicing as though
they had been victors. Free from the foreigners,
Palermo gave itself up to rejoicing, men and
women donned red shirts and acclaimed Garibaldi
as a second Cincinnatus and new Washington. All
relics of the former rulers were destroyed, Sicily
felt itself at last free to join the other states of
Italy. Immediately Cavour sent agents to urge
annexation to Piedmont, but Garibaldi was not
yet ready for that step. He planned to win Naples
and Rome before he gave over his independent
dictatorship.</p>

<p>The scene now changes to Milazzo. Thither
Garibaldi&rsquo;s army, composed of the Thousand, of
many Palermitans, of an English brigade, and of
Hungarians, Frenchmen, Italians of all ranks, all
drawn to the great general whose fame had now
spread from end to end of Europe, proceeded.
There was hard fighting at Milazzo, but in time
the city fell, and Messina lay practically open to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the invaders. A few more days and Garibaldi
was encamped there, resting and recuperating
after the entire liberation of Sicily.</p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that fortune had
showered her richest gifts on Garibaldi during this
campaign. In a few short weeks he had driven all
the Neapolitan forces out of the island with little
loss of life to his own men, had come into possession
of money, arms, boats, stores of all kinds, had
increased his army to some 25,000 men, had become
the idol of all Sicily, to whom the red shirt
became the proudest badge of man or woman, had
so thoroughly frightened King Francis II. that he
was unwilling to join his own army of defense, and
had so completely aroused Italy that from each
town young and old poured forth to make their
way to his invincible standard. Through it all,
he, whom fortune was doing everything to spoil,
remained as simple, as unmindful of personal comfort
or aggrandizement, as in his early days. He
was at his best when he won Sicily and planned
his march on Naples, it was unfortunate that the
warrior should ever have attempted to become the
statesman.</p>

<p>Garibaldi&rsquo;s army remained at Messina for twenty-three
days. During part of that time the
general was engaged in assuring the Sardinian
government that he had no interest in a revolu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>tionary
expedition which was attempting to march
into the Papal States. The rest of the time was
given to perfecting his plans for a descent on
Calabria.</p>

<p>August 19 the first detachment of the army
sailed from Taormina in the <i>Torino</i> and the
<i>Franklin</i>. The Neapolitan fleet was led into the
belief that the embarkation would be at Messina,
and by this ruse the ships succeeded in crossing to
the mainland unmolested. They landed at Melito,
and early the next morning Garibaldi prepared
to march on Reggio. Again speed stood him in
good stead. The new Army of the South, as the
Thousand with its recruits was now called, took
the Neapolitan general by surprise. At two in the
morning Garibaldi&rsquo;s army marched into the city to
find the garrison asleep. The Neapolitan soldiers,
thoroughly alarmed at the appearance of the devil,
as they named Garibaldi, so suddenly among them,
paid no heed to their officers and rushed to a
nearby fortress. There severe fighting occurred
during the afternoon and night, but finally the
stronghold capitulated, and the Garibaldians had
won an important base on the mainland. He sent
to Messina for the remainder of his troops, and
on August 22 began that celebrated &ldquo;promenade
militaire&rdquo; from Reggio to Naples, which bore
little resemblance to warfare, as the enemy fled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
as fast as he approached, and the countrymen, as
well as deserters from the army of Naples, flocked
to join his march.</p>

<p>Matters had now come to such a pass that it was
only necessary for Garibaldi to appear before a
town for it to capitulate; at Villa San Giovanni,
Garibaldi with a few hundred men back of him,
ordered 12,000 Neapolitans to surrender, and they
immediately did so. Again at Soveria he ordered
1500 of the enemy to surrender and was obeyed.
It was enough for a red shirt to appear to cause
the enemy to fly or surrender, at certain parts of
the march the Neapolitan soldiers walked side by
side with the Garibaldians. Town after town
welcomed the great general as the Liberator, as a
second John the Baptist. Both natives and Austrians
looked upon him with religious awe. He
had only to appear to be surrounded with ecstatic
multitudes, his scouts had merely to say that Garibaldi
was coming to send the enemy flying in all
haste. In one case it was enough to telegraph
he was near the town of Salerno, the defenders
immediately decamped.</p>

<p>The road to Naples lay open, the citizens of that
easily-excited capital were fairly beside themselves
in eagerness to welcome the Liberator. The general
left Salerno by train on September 7, but as
far as speed was concerned he might almost as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
have walked. The people of all the towns on the
route, Torre del Greco, Resina, Portici, turned
out, covered the railroad tracks, boarded the train,
climbed on the engine, shouting with joy, singing
the Garibaldi hymn, frantic with enthusiasm as
they hailed the man who they believed brought with
him the millennium.</p>

<p>In Naples it was the same, there was no end to
the uproar, to the enthusiasm, to the adulation.
Every one wore red, every one cheered, even the
troops of King Francis, who had retired to the
castle and fortress, could not resist the enthusiasm,
and flung up their caps and cheered for Garibaldi.</p>

<p>Naples had no government, Garibaldi appointed
a temporary governor, and issued a proclamation
glowing with patriotic fervor.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;People of Naples&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is with feelings of the profoundest respect
and love that I present myself before you in this
center of a noble and long-suffering people, whom
four centuries of tyranny have not been able to
humiliate, and whose spirit could never be broken
by a ruthless despotism. The first necessity of
Italy is harmony and social order, without which
the unity of Italy is impossible. This day Providence
has conferred that blessing upon you, and
has made me its minister. The same Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
has also given you Victor Emmanuel, whom from
this moment I will designate the father of our
country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The model of all sovereigns, he will impress
upon his posterity the duty that they owe to a
people, who have with so much enthusiasm chosen
him for their king. You are supported by the
clergy, who, conscious of their true mission, have
with patriotic ardor and truly Christian conduct,
braved the gravest dangers of battle at the head
of our Italian soldiers. The good Monks of La
Gancia, and the noble-hearted priests of the Neapolitan
continent have one and all assisted us in
the good fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I repeat that harmony is the one essential
thing for Italy, and let us freely forgive those
who, having disagreed with us, are now repentant,
and are willing to contribute their mite to build
up the monument of our national glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lastly, we must make it apparent to all that,
while we respect the houses of other people, we are
determined to be masters in our own house,
whether the powers of the earth like it or not.&mdash;G.
Garibaldi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner was the need for actual warfare at an
end than countless difficulties arose in the liberated
city. Garibaldi was no disciplinarian, he had al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>ways
entrusted all harsh measures to others, he
refused to harbor suspicion or ill-will, his nature
was patient and simple and confiding. His sole
concern was to drive the foreigners out of Italy,
beyond that he had few plans. But as soon as
Naples was free scores of theorists in government
arose. Mazzini appeared, and his followers tried
to win Garibaldi over to their ideal republic, the
clerical party had another plan, the secret societies
still another, and the brigands who infested
the country about Naples were already intriguing
for the return of the Bourbons, who had allowed
them free sway. Cavour sent his agents hurrying
to Naples to keep the people quiet and to urge
them to advocate immediate annexation with Piedmont.
He had, however, a more difficult task on
his hands at the same time. He feared that Garibaldi
would immediately march on Rome, and
Cavour knew that the Papal question could not be
settled in any such summary fashion. Napoleon
would immediately intervene, and the Army of the
South would find itself fighting France. That
was his great fear, and to prevent the event if
possible he sent the Army of Piedmont, of Lombardy,
of Tuscany south at the double quick. Victor
Emmanuel must meet Garibaldi before the latter
crossed the Volturno if trouble with France
were to be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Garibaldi, however, cared very little for diplomacy,
his object was to take Rome with all speed,
and he refused to heed Cavour&rsquo;s agents. Fortunately
Francis II. of Naples finally decided to
make a stand, and so detained Garibaldi until the
northern army could arrive. Mazzini had said to
Garibaldi, &ldquo;If you are not on your way towards
Rome or Venice before three weeks are over, your
initiative will be at an end.&rdquo; The prophecy, like
so many of Mazzini&rsquo;s, proved true. Garibaldi had
to fight several battles on the Volturno and besiege
Capua before he could turn towards Rome,
and by that time Victor Emmanuel had reached
the scene of action.</p>

<p>The last battles were the hardest fought of the
campaign, but were ultimately won by the Army
of the South. Capua held out a little longer, but
finally fell, and Francis II. took himself safely to
Gaeta.</p>

<p>On October 10 Garibaldi had called for a popular
vote in the Two Sicilies for or against their
annexation to Piedmont. The vote was overwhelmingly
for annexation. Garibaldi issued a
final proclamation, ending, &ldquo;Italy one (as the
metropolis has wisely determined she shall be),
under the King, <i>galantuomo</i>, who is the symbol of
our regeneration, and the prosperity of our country.&rdquo;
He met the King, and handed over to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
his dictatorship of the kingdom of Naples and
Sicily. This moment, which was the climax of
his great expedition, was the proudest of his
career.</p>

<p>The general was still eager for an immediate
march on Rome, but the King would not have it.
It was arranged that the Army of the South
should be incorporated with the royal army, and
Garibaldi left Naples for Caprera. He borrowed
$100 to pay certain debts, and in the same meager
state in which he had set out he returned to his
rock of Caprera to wait until he should be needed.</p>

<p>At Caprera the general, now become the most
romantic figure in Europe, received countless deputations
of admirers from all nations. For a short
time he was content to resume his farm labors, but
the thought of Rome loomed ever larger in his
mind. He had not the gift of patience now, he
was convinced that his army of volunteers could
fight and overcome both France and Austria. The
delays of Cavour&rsquo;s policy irritated him, and finally
he went in April, 1861, to the Parliament at Turin
to speak his mind. He made a violent attack on
Cavour, to which the latter would not reply in
kind. A few days later the two men met at the
King&rsquo;s request and pretended a reconciliation.
Garibaldi could not appreciate Cavour&rsquo;s temperate
statecraft, Cavour realized that Garibaldi was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
becoming the most difficult problem Italy had to
face. Unfortunately for Garibaldi, and doubly
unfortunately for Italy, Cavour was failing in
strength, and only a short time after the scene in
Turin the great Minister died. If he had lived
Italy would have been spared much that followed.</p>

<p>Garibaldi returned to Caprera and watched
from afar the policies of the new premiers, first
Ricasoli, then Rattazzi. The latter was always
suspected of French leanings, and the extremists
were bitterly opposed to him. He was a brilliant
man, fated to meet disasters, as day after day
passed he found that the Garibaldian problem
called ever louder for solution. He saw that
Genoa, Sicily, and Naples were hotbeds of turbulence,
he knew that the people of the last-named
city had made a god of Garibaldi, had built altars
to him, and were imploring him to lead them
against the Pope, he knew that even in the Eternal
City hundreds were calling to him to deliver them.
Yet Rattazzi also knew that the problem of the
temporal power of the Pope was one of concern
to all Europe, and that Italy was not ready to
fight both France and Austria. His final solution
was this, one which must not be judged too
harshly when all the circumstances are considered,
to encourage Garibaldi to start a popular campaign
against the Pope, and then send the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
army to arrest him as fomenting civil strife. The
plan succeeded. In the spring of 1862 Garibaldi
could restrain his eagerness no longer. He announced
to his delighted followers that he would
lead them to Rome. He was given to understand
the government would not actively interfere.
So, two years after his first expedition, we find him
again arriving triumphantly in Sicily, again we
find men of all classes flocking to him, again by
strategy he crossed the straits to Calabria and
took up his northward march. He had not gone
far when he found that the royal army was marching
against him. He became convinced of this
when he bivouacked on the famous hill of Aspromonte
and saw the royal general, Pallavicini,
camped opposite him. The next day he tried to
lead his soldiers past the other army, but they
were stopped by the regular troops. Both generals
affirmed that they gave no orders to fire, but
nevertheless shots were exchanged, and both Garibaldi
and his son Menotti were wounded. A truce
was agreed upon, and the volunteers were placed
under the charge of the royal army. Garibaldi
became a state prisoner, perhaps the most difficult
prisoner any government ever had to take upon
its hands. All Italy was devoted to him, but
found that it could not control him. The government
had been placed in the most embarrassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
situation conceivable, it had been obliged to disarm
the man who had just given the King two
crowns. Aspromonte remains one of the most unfortunate
events in the great battle for Italian
unity, but it was in a large measure inevitable.
Cavour might have contrived an escape from it,
but Garibaldi was too big a problem for his successors
to handle diplomatically.</p>

<p>The wounded general was taken by slow conveyances
to Scylla, and thence to the fort of
Varignano in the Gulf of Spezia. The wound
was painful, it was difficult to locate the bullet,
for a long time he was obliged to keep to his bed
and postpone further political action. His illness,
however, gave his friends a golden opportunity
to show their devotion; women of all ranks fought
for the chance to nurse the hero, delegations from
England, from Germany, from all parts of Italy
made pilgrimages to his prison, the hotels at
Spezia, the nearest town to the fortress, were
continually crowded by Garibaldi worshipers. It
seemed that what he had suffered at Aspromonte
had actually canonized him in the eyes of the
world.</p>

<p>His imprisonment could not last long; October
5, 1862, the government declared an amnesty
covering all participators in the late expedition
against Rome except those soldiers who had left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the regular army to join the volunteers. Garibaldi
was now moved to Spezia, thence after a time to
Pisa. Each city he passed greeted him tumultuously;
in Pisa, the night of his arrival, the Garibaldi
hymn was cheered so loudly at the theater
that the manager abandoned the play and had
nothing but the hymn rendered all the evening,
which pleased the audience greatly. At Pisa the
bullet was extracted from Garibaldi&rsquo;s foot, and
his recovery became more rapid. On December
20 he started for Caprera, giving a chance for
Leghorn to welcome him as he embarked for his
island home. Once there he found the rest of which
he was so much in need, although visitors continually
besieged his little farm. The kindly instincts
of his nature showed in full flower, he gave
whatever his children or his friends asked of him,
sacrificing his own comforts continually for their
sake, and continually being imposed upon. He
wrote to the patriots suffering in Poland and Denmark,
and wished that he might go to aid them.
Wherever men were in trouble he sympathized, he
could even find it in his heart to contribute to the
poor of Austria.</p>

<p>There were friends of the national cause who
feared that the affair of Aspromonte had injured
Garibaldi&rsquo;s prestige, and to revive it in full glory
they planned his triumphal visit to England in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the spring of 1863. Garibaldi had always admired
the English, and there was no question but
that the people of England had always zealously
sided with Italy against France and Austria, no
matter how strongly their government might feel
that diplomacy required a middle course. The
general went from Caprera to Southampton, and
thence to London, acclaimed by thousands, who
rivaled the warm-spirited Neapolitans in their
heights of enthusiasm. The modest, benign-faced
warrior was f√™ted as a national deliverer, the
streets of London rang with his hymn, women
adopted the famous red Garibaldi shirt as the
latest fashion, aristocrats and working people
fought for the opportunity of entertaining him.
Before he could take up his northern tour, however,
it was announced that he was overtired and
would have to leave the country for rest. His
physicians denied this, and it appears as most
probable that Louis Napoleon was so much displeased
and even alarmed at the popular acclaim
given the general that he made his wish known to
Lord Palmerston that the guest leave English
shores. Again Garibaldi proved a serious burden
to diplomacy, his very fame made him the more
difficult to deal with. So rather than cause further
international trouble the general bade England an
affectionate farewell and returned to Caprera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The campaign of 1866, which won Venetia for
the kingdom of Victor Emmanuel, is not a glorious
page in Italian history. Venice was freed from
Austria&rsquo;s rule because the Prussians won the battles
of Sadowa and K√∂niggratz. What victories
Italy won fell to the score of the volunteers fighting
with Garibaldi in the Lakes rather than to
the regular army of the new nation. From the
date of the Liberator&rsquo;s return from England up
to the spring of 1866 he lived in comparative
quiet, spending most of his time at Caprera, and
only making occasional visits to the mainland.
Meanwhile events were rapidly showing that Prussia
and Austria must soon fight for the supremacy
in Germany, and Victor Emmanuel concluded an
alliance with Berlin. Then, in May, 1866, Garibaldi
was asked by the Italian Minister of War to
take command of the volunteer forces. He accepted
gladly, and, as so often before, the news
that he was about to take the field was sufficient to
gather innumerable patriots about him. Unfortunately
the generals of the regular army were
again jealous of Garibaldi, and continual obstacles
were placed in his way, even his own officers speedily
formed cliques and wrought dissension in his
command. He was ordered to attack Austria from
Como, and so through the Lakes rather than from
Hungary as he would have preferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, with all these obstacles the campaign
started at Como with much of the old spirit. Again
the veterans of 1859 and 1860, many of the
famous Thousand, many who had fought at Messala
and on the Volturno, gathered, clad in red
shirts, on the banks of Lake Como, and raised the
Garibaldi hymn. Scores of enthusiastic Englishmen
could not keep away from the Lakes, an Englishwoman
and her husband followed the general
all through the campaign, carrying a cooking-stove
and store of provisions for their idol. But
notwithstanding all the enthusiasm the efforts to
dislodge the enemy were not very successful. The
Austrians were not as easily frightened or defeated
as had been the soldiers of the King of
Naples, and the people of the Tyrol did not rise
and join Garibaldi&rsquo;s ranks as had the Sicilians
and Calabrians. The commissariat service was
wretched, time and again the troops bivouacked
without shelter or food, conflicting orders were
given, and but for their remarkable light-heartedness
and faith in their general the men would have
been in very bad shape for any manner of combat.
On the first day of real fighting, at Rocca d&rsquo;Anfo,
Garibaldi was wounded in the thigh, and after that
had to direct operations from a carriage. Nevertheless,
he lost nothing of his confidence, and
planned his successive moves through the moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>tains
and lakes with his old skill in this form of
irregular warfare.</p>

<p>The actual military operations were of no permanent
importance, the volunteers were sent down
the beautiful Lake of Como to Lecco accompanied
by a fleet of private boats filled with admiring
friends. From Lecco they went to Bergamo and
thence to Brescia, and then for a time their headquarters
were at Sal√≤, on the Lake of Garda. An
eye-witness contrasts their informal style of
marching with that of the regulars: &ldquo;Some of
them were lying at full length on bullock wagons,
with their rifles decorated with roses at their sides,
others were trudging sturdily along in the loosest
manner, smoking, with their shirts open, and their
rugs rolled across their bodies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Garibaldi had completed his plans for
marching north he received word from General
La Marmora to take Lonato, and turned there from
Sal√≤. The Austrians withdrew before the Italian
advance, and the latter army was free to enter the
Trentino. Their first step in this direction was to
take the rocky fort of Rocca d&rsquo;Anfo, and after
that they marched on Darzo, which was the scene
of much fighting, and then on to the fort of Ampola.
On July 16 the volunteers dragged their
cannon into position on the mountains, and on the
17th the real attack began. Ampola capitulated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and the march to Riva began through the Ledro
valley. At a village near Bizecca they were attacked
early in the morning. The Austrians opened
fire from the village houses. Chiassi, one of Garibaldi&rsquo;s
veterans, was killed, and for a time the
volunteers made little headway. Garibaldi&rsquo;s two
sons and his son-in-law Canzio did their utmost to
encourage the men behind them, and gradually
what had threatened to be a rout was turned into
a victory. Bizecca was immediately captured, and
the troops had started their march to Lardaro
when news came that an armistice was being arranged,
and orders were brought to Garibaldi bidding
him leave the Trentino.</p>

<p>The Italian army had met with a reverse at the
battle of Custozza, but fortunately their Prussian
allies had already won the two great victories of
K√∂niggratz and Sadowa and were in a position to
dictate terms to Austria. The oft-fought-over
Venetian provinces became at last part of the kingdom
of Italy. Venice was added to her sister cities,
which now only lacked Rome. The Tyrol, however,
was left with Austria, and so Garibaldi
viewed the peace with disappointment. He was
confident that his volunteers could have won it, and
found this another instance of the mistakes of
statesmanship.</p>

<p>As after the expedition of the Thousand, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
after the campaign in the Lakes, Garibaldi found
that he could not rest quietly with Rome in Papal
hands. Italy was bound by agreement with
France to leave Pius IX. in temporary possession
of the Eternal City, but Garibaldi cared little or
nothing for his country&rsquo;s obligations. He showed
in a hundred ways that he was unwilling that the
kingdom should have rest or a chance to recuperate
until the city on the Tiber was won, and so again
in 1867, as in 1862, he became a tremendously
difficult problem to the government, the seat of
which had been moved from Turin to Florence,
and of which Rattazzi was again the head.</p>

<p>As soon as the French left Rome a number of
revolutionary societies commenced operations in
that city, and Garibaldi was asked to act in conjunction
with them. He made an electioneering
tour in the spring of 1867, and was received at
Venice, at Verona, and at Legnano with a veneration
that partook of religious awe. He was elected
deputy in the new Parliament from four districts.
He next appeared at the meeting of the Universal
Peace Congress at Geneva, and spoke against the
priesthood, denouncing the Papacy with his accustomed
ardor. He then returned to Italy and
in a fiery speech at the Villa Cairoli called on his
countrymen to march on Rome. He started for
the Papal frontier, and the volunteers collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
about him so rapidly that Rattazzi was again
obliged to arrange for his arrest. At Sinalunga
he was taken prisoner, and conveyed to Alessandria,
and there arrangements were made to take
him to his home at Caprera and keep him virtually
imprisoned there. Unfortunately Garibaldi could
not be kept quiet; even when his island was guarded
by four steamers and a frigate he managed to send
appeals to the mainland and keep the revolutionary
party alert. Other leaders were attacking
Rome by now, Nicotera was advancing from
Naples, Menotti Garibaldi was waging guerilla
warfare near Tivoli, the brothers Cairoli&mdash;name
famous in Italian annals&mdash;made their daring attack
at the Vigna Glori. Pius IX. and his Secretary
of State, Cardinal Antonelli, were not having
a pleasant time in Rome. Barracks were blown up,
bombs were discovered, petitions were presented
from his subjects urging him to call in the army of
Victor Emmanuel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Garibaldi planned and executed his
daring escape from Caprera. He pretended to be
ill, and then one dark night set off in a small boat
for Sardinia. He lay hidden until he could get
horses to take him to Porta Prudenza, and from
there sailed with his son-in-law Canzio to the mainland.
A day or two later he was brazenly haranguing
the people from the Loggia dei Lanzi in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Florence. The government learned that they
could not control him, and now concluded to repeat
the tactics of Aspromonte, and allow him to bring
about his own destruction.</p>

<p>At Terni Garibaldi began active campaigning.
He met his troops, and planned an immediate attack
on the town of Monte Rotondo, which crowns
a hill overlooking the Tiber and the roads to Rome.
The hill town was hotly defended, but the volunteers
finally took it. From there, after a short
stay, Garibaldi moved his army, now numbering
15,000 men, on towards the Ponte della Mentana,
some four and a half miles from Rome. It is said
that an agreement had been made by which the
Papal governor of the castle of St. Angelo was to
surrender his post for a sum of money, and that
this sum was raised by Garibaldi&rsquo;s English friends,
but through treachery was not properly used.
This occasioned some delay, and by that time
French troops had been landed and were marching
to the aid of their allies, the Papal guards.</p>

<p>The general was obliged to retreat temporarily
to Monte Rotondo, and there he issued a public
address. He relied on the fact that the Roman
Republic of 1849 had made him a Roman general.
After rehearsing the facts of the Italian government&rsquo;s
position he said, &ldquo;Then will I let the world
know that I alone, a Roman general, with full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
power, elected by the universal suffrage of the only
legal government in Rome, the Republic, have the
right to maintain myself armed in this, the territory
under my jurisdiction; and then if these
my volunteers, champions of liberty and Italian
unity, wish to have Rome as the capital of Italy,
fulfilling the vote of Parliament and of the nation,
they must not put down their arms until Italy
shall have acquired liberty of conscience and worship,
built upon the ruin of Jesuitism, and until
the soldiers of tyrants shall be banished from our
land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The French had now joined the Papal army,
and the Italian troops were massing in Garibaldi&rsquo;s
rear. On November 3 he started towards Tivoli, but
had to fall back on Mentana, and there occurred
the battle which decided the fate of the expedition.
The volunteers fought with the greatest courage
and enthusiasm, but their arms were no match for
the new chassepots of the French. Garibaldi had
to fall back on Monte Rotondo, and there, on discovering
that his men had scarcely a cartridge
left, he was forced to order a further retreat. The
expedition was at an end, the volunteers were disbanded,
and Garibaldi took train to Florence.
There he was arrested and conveyed a prisoner to
the fort of Varignano.</p>

<p>The battle of Mentana had cost many Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
lives. Victor Emmanuel was deeply grieved and
had a message sent to the French Emperor: &ldquo;The
last events have suffocated every remembrance of
gratitude in the heart of Italy. It is no longer in
the power of the government to maintain an alliance
with France, the chassepot gun at Mentana
has given it a fatal blow.&rdquo; The battle therefore
had the result of severing the tacit alliance between
Italy and France, and henceforth the problem
of Roman occupation became simpler to the
King&rsquo;s government.</p>

<p>In 1870 the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian
war compelled Napoleon to defend his own borders,
and no longer to support a Papal government in
a foreign land. When the French and Germans
were fighting the question of the temporal power
of the Church was quietly settled, with almost no
fighting and little outside attention, by the entrance
of the King of Italy into Rome. At last
Italy was united. Garibaldi had nothing to do
with this final occupation, for which he had laid
plans since his early South American days.</p>

<p>When Napoleon was eliminated from French
politics Garibaldi could no longer restrain his
ardor for the republican government. He took
sword, and left Caprera to volunteer for service
with France. He was given command of the army
of the Vosges, and his campaign against the Prus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>sians
at Autun and Dijon was at least as successful
as that of the regular French generals. The
Prussians were too strong, the Army of the East
gave way before them, and Garibaldi&rsquo;s brief campaign
was at an end. After the peace he was
elected deputy from Paris, Dijon, and Nice, but
was not allowed to sit in the Assembly on the
ground that he was a foreigner. He received the
official thanks of the French government and returned
home.</p>

<p>There remained a somewhat turbulent old age
for Garibaldi. Italy was united and rapidly
growing stronger under the happy influence of
continued peace. Garibaldi, however, could not
remain quiet, and when he appeared in public he
was publicly worshiped and privately feared. He
became more and more ardently a republican as
time went on, and his republicanism was only too
apt to take the color of the last man with whom
he had talked. He was not an able original
thinker, and except in military man&oelig;uvers had always
been too much inclined to lean on the advice
of others.</p>

<p>In the elections of 1874 the general was chosen
by several districts, among others the city of Rome,
to sit in the Senate. He made a triumphal progress
from Caprera to the capital, and when he
was sworn in as a Senator the members forgot all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
past and present difficulties and cheered to the
echo the man who had led the Thousand from
Genoa to Naples. He went to the Quirinal to see
the King, a sovereign whom he had ardently admired
since the time when he had first seen him in
battle. A little later we find him a member of a
committee with the King and Prince Torlonia to
divert the course of the Tiber and improve the
Campagna.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at Caprera Francesca, the devoted
woman who had first gone there to nurse Garibaldi&rsquo;s
daughter, had taken Anita&rsquo;s position, and
become the mother of the general&rsquo;s youngest children,
Manlio and Clelia. In 1880 the Court of
Appeal at Rome declared Garibaldi&rsquo;s marriage to
Giuseppina Raymondi, the adventuress who had
taken advantage of him long before, null and void.
Fortunately the marriage had been contracted
under Austrian and not Italian jurisdiction. Had
it been otherwise the annulment would not have
been allowed. Immediately on receipt of the news
Garibaldi and Francesca were married. At Caprera
Garibaldi lived like an island prince, continually
receiving visits and presents from admirers
of all nations.</p>

<p>Yet, for all his domestic happiness, the old warrior
would mix in public affairs, and almost always
as an opponent of the existing government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Even when his old friend and comrade-in-arms,
Benedetto Cairoli, fourth of the famous brothers,
became Prime Minister, he was not content with
his policies. He embarrassed the government by
continually writing ultra-radical letters to the
newspapers. Two or three times more he appeared
in public, became again an active figure when his
son-in-law Canzio was arrested at a turbulent
meeting in Genoa, and resigned his seat in the
National Chambers. He was, however, too worn
out physically to make further dangerous expeditions,
and was persuaded to leave the more active
part to younger men. In 1882 he died at Caprera.</p>

<p>Neither the character nor the achievements of
Garibaldi are difficult to estimate. His character
was simple, he was ingenuously frank and open-minded,
absolutely sincere, warm-hearted, and
forgiving to a fault. His whole career is filled
with instances in which his generosity was traded
on, notably the case of his second marriage. He
was always frugal, unostentatious, unselfish, never
did a breath of public scandal sully his name. Although
he had many opportunities to gain wealth
he was always poor. During the last days of his
life he enjoyed a pension from the government,
but the most of that was given to his children or
dispensed in charity.</p>

<p>Given this true, straightforward nature, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
find that from his boyhood he had above everything
desired a free united Italy, with Rome as its
capital. The name Rome never failed to thrill
him. So long as the master-hand of Cavour was
ready to guide him Garibaldi proceeded gloriously
forward, the crusader who could lead men into
battle and fill them with a great enthusiasm.
Cavour could fight against the Mazzinian theories
of a republic, he had to fight hard to keep the
soldier in the straight path, particularly in those
early days in Naples, but he succeeded, and saw
Garibaldi proudly deliver Naples and Sicily into
the care of his King. How great was Cavour&rsquo;s
steering hand we find in later years; without that
powerful mind to control him, Garibaldi fell under
the influence of many different types of men, and
his simple confiding nature found it easy to trust
each seeming friend in turn. The very virtue of his
nature acted against him then, he became a tool
for men to use, his great name a flag for any new
quixotic idea. It was only when he was fighting
that he was his own commander, at other times he
was ever ready to sink his own opinions in those
of others. The latter part of his life was therefore
continually stormy, he had not the art to
weather varying changes in national sentiment.</p>

<p>Almost as easy to estimate as his character were
his achievements. They were superlatively great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
for Italy. Nobody can tell whether Cavour&rsquo;s
diplomacy alone would ever have won the Kingdom
of the Two Sicilies. Garibaldi started from Genoa
on an expedition that seemed doomed to disaster,
but which, successfully begun, carried all opposition
before it. It is true that the army of Francis
II. was poor, and that the battles, with the exception
of Calatafimi in Sicily, are not to be classed
as great conflicts, but Garibaldi did much more
than win battles, he roused the people to a pitch
of fighting spirit they had never known before.
The fame of the Thousand spread across Europe,
and with it rose European admiration and interest
in the Italian cause. Foreigners joined his army,
and when the great general met Victor Emmanuel
and gave over the two crowns he had won the eyes
of the whole world were focused on the sovereign
and the hero. The glory of that expedition could
not fade, whatever Garibaldi did later could not
efface the memory of those great days; even
the governments that found him rebelling against
the laws and treaties they had made could not but
thrill at the recollection of the days of 1860 and
1861. The red shirt became an oriflamme to lovers
of liberty in all lands, the Garibaldian hymn set
hearts to dancing with pride and exultation, the
simple soldier with his dramatic effects of life and
bearing became an Italian national hero with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the mythical charm of a Cid Campeador or a William
Tell. He will take a place in Italian legendary
history that was empty until his day.</p>

<p>This atmosphere of romance that surrounded
him was of his nature. He wrote two books, one,
&ldquo;The Rule of the Monk,&rdquo; which appeared after
his imprisonment at Varignano, the other, &ldquo;The
Thousand,&rdquo; after the Vosges campaign. They
were both extravagant, artificial, as wildly eventful
as any novels ever penned. Yet in a sense they
catch the flavor of his own career. When he describes
the monks he pictures them as they actually
seemed to him, agents of the power which had so
hounded him after the siege of Rome, and which
had executed his friend Ugo Bassi. When he
writes of &ldquo;The Thousand&rdquo; he shows his followers
as men capable of any heroism, and the expedition
becomes one series of marvellous adventures. He
saw that intensely dramatic side of the struggle,
and he became the symbol of that dramatic element
in the eyes of the world. His country needed that
symbol, the glory of a crusader was as essential
to Italian redemption as the soul-stirring fanaticism
of a Mazzini, the statecraft of a Cavour, or
the kingship of a Victor Emmanuel. He was the
living personification of the great fight for liberty;
that was his contribution to the cause.</p>

<h2><a name="VICTOR_EMMANUEL_THE_KING" id="VICTOR_EMMANUEL_THE_KING">VICTOR EMMANUEL, THE KING</a></h2>


<p class="start-chap"><span class="smcap">Few</span> royal families in Europe possess as proud
a record as the House of Savoy. Legend carries
their race as Princes back to 998, when an exiled
noble of Saxon birth settled in Burgundy, and
ultimately built a family stronghold at the pass
of Moriana on the frontier of Savoy. This prince
was known as Humbert of the White Hand. He
was followed by a series of fighting, ambitious, able
descendants, who gradually carved for themselves
the Dukedom of Savoy, and married into the most
powerful of contemporary royal families. Their
small state was so centrally placed that it early
became a storm-center, and for centuries the Dukes
were famous as warrior-adventurers, fighting now
under the banner of the Empire, now under that
of Spain or of France. Happily the Dukes of
Savoy shared little of the tyrannical natures of
their neighbors, they were not altogether saintly,
but they were surprisingly merciful and just in an
age famous for cruel bigotry. Emmanuel Philibert,
better known as &ldquo;Testa di Ferro,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Head
of Iron,&rdquo; one of the most popular of Piedmont&rsquo;s
heroes, became a great favorite with the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Charles V., was a general of renown, and secured
firm possession of his Savoy lands. From his time
the position of the family became more assured.</p>

<p>In 1703, Victor Amadeus, fifteenth Duke of
Savoy, assumed the title of King of Sicily, as a
result of a treaty following his defense of Turin
and overturning of the Bourbon power in Italy.
Shortly thereafter Sicily was exchanged for Sardinia
and certain territories adjoining his frontiers,
and the title of the head of the house of
Savoy became King of Sardinia.</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel I. of Sardinia, who succeeded
his brother Charles Emmanuel IV., was a brave,
thoroughly good-hearted man, whose nature was,
however, absolutely medi√¶val. He was much under
the influence of Austria, to whose Emperor he had
given a promise that he would never grant his
people a free constitution. He finally abdicated
in favor of his brother Charles Felix, a man of a
much narrower nature, who did all in his power to
check the free-thinking sentiments rapidly spreading
through his people as a result of the Revolution
in France. When he died in 1831 the elder
branch of the House of Savoy came to an end, but
fortunately there was a distantly related younger
branch, known as the Princes of Carignano and
Savoy. The seventh Prince of this line, Charles
Albert, born in 1798, had married a daughter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and had been a great
favorite with Victor Emmanuel I. On the death
of that King he had acted for a short time as
regent for Charles Felix, and had then served in
the war between France and Spain, winning a
great reputation for bravery. When Charles
Felix died he succeeded him as King of Sardinia in
1831.</p>

<p>Charles Albert was one of the most interesting
characters of the early Nineteenth Century, a man
of the noblest character, burning with the desire
to free Italy from the foreigner, but always suspicious
that he was not the man to do it. This
suspicion was continually played upon by the clerical
party at the court of Turin, and with the result
that the King, as firm a Roman Catholic as
his ancestors, and by nature devout almost to mysticism,
was the continual battle-field of the warring
sentiments of love of liberty and love of the Church.
During the reign of Victor Emmanuel I. the liberal
party in Piedmont looked upon Charles Albert
as their natural leader. He often spoke of his desire
to see Italy united, and made little concealment
of his hostility to Austria and the Bourbon princes.
Yet, when he was actually invited to lead the Piedmont
&ldquo;Federates&rdquo; as they were called, whose object
was simply the confederation of Italy, he
could not make up his mind to accept. As Santa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Rosa, the leader of the party, said, &ldquo;He both
would, and would not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel I., bound by his promise to
the house of Austria, had yet seen that his people
were bent on reforms, and rather than break his
word and grant a constitution he had abdicated
in favor of Charles Felix. Immediately the liberals
had besieged the regent, Charles Albert, with
petitions and a show of force which could not be
denied. He had then proclaimed the constitution,
accompanying it with this declaration: &ldquo;Our
respect and submission to his majesty Charles
Felix, to whom the throne belongs, would have
hindered us making any fundamental change in
the laws of the realm until the sovereign&rsquo;s intentions
were known; but as the force of circumstances
is manifest, and we desire to render to the
new King his people safe, uninjured, and happy,
and not in a civil war, having maturely considered
everything, and with the advice of our council, we
have decided, in the hope that his majesty, moved
by the same considerations, will give his approval,
that the constitution of Spain shall be promulgated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Charles Felix, when he came to Turin,
would have none of this constitution, and Charles
Albert left Piedmont under the shadow of his kinsman&rsquo;s
displeasure. When a few years later he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
himself ascended the throne the popular idea of
him as an advocate of liberalism was still current,
and it was this idea which led Mazzini to write to
the new sovereign that remarkable letter on behalf
of &ldquo;Young Italy,&rdquo; commencing, &ldquo;All Italy waits
for one word&mdash;one only&mdash;to make herself yours.&rdquo;
But Charles Albert was at that crucial moment
under priestly influence, and he paid no
heed to the letter, as a result of which the growing
Mazzinian party, which might have been attached
to the interests of the House of Savoy, became
strongly republican.</p>

<p>The Jesuits at Turin, secret agents of the Austrian
government, did their utmost to frighten
the King with gross misrepresentations as to the
liberals. When new conspiracies broke out in 1833
Charles Albert was influenced to punish the rebels
severely. Gradually the popular idea concerning
the King changed, and those who had thought to
find in him an emancipator became slowly convinced
that he was as rigid a reactionary as any
of his predecessors. So the poor King, really
ardent in his country&rsquo;s cause, played upon by his
courtiers and the insidious clericals, watched his
chances of leading Italy against Austria gradually
dwindle.</p>

<p>Some men, however, still believed that Charles
Albert was the only present hope for Italy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
chief among these men was Massimo d&rsquo;Azeglio. He
was a man of keen insight and high character, and
had traveled through all the states of Italy studying
the forces making towards nationality. At
the end of his travels he had an audience of
Charles Albert at Turin, and reported what he
had found. His estimate of the King was justified
by the reply Charles Albert made to him. &ldquo;Let
those gentlemen know,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;that for
the present they must remain quiet; but when the
time comes, let them be certain that my life, the
lives of my sons, my arms, my treasures&mdash;all shall
be freely spent in the Italian cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came the election of Pius IX. to the throne
of Saint Peter, and a great wave of enthusiasm
swept through the liberal party throughout Italy.
Pius was a great advance on the narrow, medi√¶val-minded
Leo XII. and Gregory XVI., who had preceded
him. The Romans felt new hope, and with
each month the great enthusiasm spread until it
culminated in the sudden Lombard expulsion of
the Austrians from Milan. Charles Albert must
have seen the signs that preceded the eventful
years of 1848 and 1849. He had decided to grant
a constitution to his people, whether Austria liked
it or not, and on February 7, 1848, proclaimed the
famous <i>Statuto</i>. Events hurried, a short time and
Lombardy and Venice were in arms and Piedmont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
determined on supporting them. Charles Albert,
and his eldest son, Victor Emmanuel, threw themselves
utterly into the national cause.</p>

<p>On March 14, 1820, the Prince Victor Emmanuel
was born in the Carignano Palace at Turin,
his father being then simply the Prince of Savoy-Carignano.
With the accession of Charles Felix
the family moved to a villa near Florence, and
there the young Prince spent his early boyhood.
His younger brother, Ferdinand, Duke of Genoa,
was born in 1822. After the reconciliation between
Charles Felix and the Prince of Carignano
the latter took up his residence in the castle of
Racconigi, in Piedmont. When Prince Victor was
eleven years old his father came to the throne, and
thenceforth the young Prince lived in Turin. He
and his brother were inseparable, although widely
different in temperament, Victor enthusiastic, impulsive,
overflowing with animal spirits, Ferdinand
more prudent, calm, and thoughtful, strongly resembling
his father.</p>

<p>Charles Albert devoted the greatest care to the
education and military training of his sons, and
both fully repaid his care. Victor Emmanuel,
Duke of Savoy, was not a great student, but he
was keenly interested in everything that pertained
to government, sympathetic, observant, deeply imbued
with the desire to see Italy free and Piedmont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the leader in that cause. His manners were essentially
frank and cordial, his whole bearing inspired
confidence. At twenty-one he was of middle
height, powerfully built, with features strong,
rather than handsome, a curling mustache adding
to the military aspect of his face. At twenty-two
he sought the hand of his first cousin, Maria Adelaide,
daughter of the Austrian Archduke Ranieri,
Viceroy of Lombardy-Venice, and of Charles Albert&rsquo;s
only sister. The chief objection to the marriage
was the fact that the Princess Adelaide was
partly Austrian, but Victor overcame this objection,
and the marriage took place in 1842. It was
not long before the young Princess had become
the idol of Piedmont through her many gifts of
charm.</p>

<p>When the news of the rising of Milan on March
18, 1848, came to Turin the Duke of Savoy was
filled with joy. The King and his ministers were
deliberating with deep concern the position that
Piedmont should adopt, but the young Prince was
concerned only with taking the field against Austria.
He had that pure love for the dangers of
war which had been such a marked characteristic
of his ancestors, and which had made the House of
Savoy famous during the Middle Ages. The biographer
Massari wrote of him later, &ldquo;Without
using a profusion of words, it is enough to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
that under the canvas or in the battle-field he
showed himself worthy of his race. He who knows
the story of the Savoy dynasty knows that there
is no higher eulogium than this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was given a command in the troops that were
hurried to the aid of Lombardy, and fought his
first battle at Santa Lucia on May 6th. He was
conspicuous for courage, and in addition to his
personal power of inspiring his soldiers with enthusiasm,
proved himself a careful general. At
Goito, where the Austrians took the troops of Piedmont
by surprise, the Duke of Savoy converted
a retreat into a desperate attack by throwing himself
before the troops and calling on them to save
the honor of Savoy. He was wounded in the thigh,
but fought on, and at length had the satisfaction
of reporting to his father that Piedmont had won
the day. He was awarded a medal for valor on
the field of action, but he valued more the wound
which he had won in fighting for Italy.</p>

<p>The fortunes of war soon brought a change.
The other states of Italy did not come to the aid
of Lombardy as Charles Albert had been given
assurances that they would. Pius IX. had placed
an army in the field to prevent Austrian outrages
on his frontiers, but had given them orders not to
attack the enemy. The King of Naples had declared
his intention of siding with the other Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
states, but by deceit and treachery kept his army
too far from the scene of action to be of any use.
The Venetians were fully occupied with their revolution
at home, the Lombards had already begun
to determine what they would do when they were
free, and Piedmont was left practically alone to
fight the rapidly reviving army of Austria.</p>

<p>One more victory was won at Staffola, but the
next day the Piedmontese were attacked again and
defeated at Custozza. The King was advised to
retreat across the Po to Piacenza, but instead felt
that his duty called him to Milan. He entered
that city, but his army, worn out, and attacked
by a much superior force, could not defend the
Lombard capital, and he was forced to capitulate.
The Milanese were not grateful, they bitterly assailed
the King for what they called his treachery,
and he escaped from the city through the aid of
a young officer, later the General La Marmora.</p>

<p>Still the unfortunate King would not abandon
the war, although he saw the hopelessness of the
situation, left as he was to fight single-handed.
March 20, 1849, the fighting recommenced, and
lasted for three days. At Martara the pick of the
Piedmontese army were destroyed. When Charles
Albert heard the news he realized that he was
destined to utter defeat. Yet he took up the march
to Novara, stoical as became his race. The battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of Novara, fought March 23, 1849, marked the
end. The Piedmontese fought heroically, the
Duke of Savoy led his men time and again to the
attack, his younger brother, the Duke of Genoa,
had three horses killed under him, but bravery
could not overcome the disparity in strength. An
armistice was asked for, but the terms of Marshal
Radetsky were too hard to accept. The King said
to his generals, &ldquo;Gentlemen, we cannot accept
these conditions. Is it possible that we can resume
hostilities?&rdquo; The answer was a unanimous
&ldquo;no.&rdquo; Then the unfortunate King laid down the
burdens of his too heavy office in these touching
words: &ldquo;From eighteen years till now I have always
made every effort possible for the benefit of
the people. I am deeply afflicted to see that my
hopes have failed, not so much for my own sake
as for the country&rsquo;s. I have not been able to find
death on the field of battle, as I had desired; perhaps
my existence is now the only obstacle to obtaining
from the enemy reasonable terms, and
since there remains no further means of continuing
hostilities, I abdicate this moment, in favor of my
son Vittorio, in the hope that, renewing negotiations
with Radetsky, the new King may obtain
better conditions, and procure for the country an
advantageous peace. Behold your King!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The entreaties of the son and the generals were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
useless, Charles Albert was determined. He knew
that his dream of liberating Italy was over, that
he was not the man for the great work. That
night he set out with one companion for Oporto
in Portugal, there to live obscurely while his son
took up the heavy burden of rebuilding Piedmont&rsquo;s
hopes.</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel came to the throne at a distressing
moment, but from the first he showed the
true metal of his nature. His father had been a
dreamer, a theorist, alternating between eagerness
to press forward and the desire to retain what he
already had. His character, although fine, was
not robust. The young King, however, was essentially
robust-natured, the very type of man above
all others needed at this particular crisis. He
faced Marshal Radetsky fearlessly, and, when the
Austrian general insisted on the same terms demanded
of his father, including the immediate expulsion
of all Italian exiles from the state of Piedmont,
replied, &ldquo;Sooner than subscribe to such
conditions I would lose a hundred crowns. What
my father has sworn I will maintain. If you wish
a war to the death, be it so! I will call my nation
to arms once more, and you will see what Piedmont
is capable of in a general rising. If I must fall,
it shall be without shame. My house knows the
road of exile, but not of dishonor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally an armistice was concluded. The King
of Sardinia was to disband all the military corps
composed of Lombards, Poles, Hungarians, and
other foreign peoples, retaining only those who
chose to remain his subjects permanently; a heavy
war indemnity was to be paid to Austria, half the
fortress of Alessandria was to be given up to Austria,
and her troops were to be allowed to occupy
Piedmontese territory between the rivers Po, Sesia,
and Ticino. It was a hard bargain that Austria
drove.</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel returned to his capital to find
many of its citizens disaffected by the appeals of
the republican party. All Turin was in despair
over the sad termination of a campaign that had
promised so much. The King, the Queen, and
their two sons, Humbert, aged five, and Amadeus,
aged four, were received with the coldest regard
as they appeared in public. The King issued this
proclamation to his people: &ldquo;Citizens,&mdash;Untoward
events and the will of my most venerated
parent have called me, long before my time, to the
throne of my ancestors. The circumstances under
which I hold the reins of government are such that
nothing but the most perfect concord in all will
enable me, and then with difficulty, to fulfil my
only desire, the salvation of our common country.
The destines of nations are matured in the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>signs
of Providence, but man owes to his country
all the service he is capable of, and in this debt we
have not failed. Now all our efforts must be to
maintain our honor untarnished, to heal the
wounds of our country, to consolidate our constitutional
institutions. To this undertaking I conjure
all my people, to it I will pledge myself by a
solemn oath, and I await from the nation the exchange
of help, affection, and confidence.&mdash;Victor
Emmanuel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On March 29 the new King took the oath to
the constitution which had so recently been granted
by his father. General Delaunay formed the new
ministry, which almost immediately decided to dissolve
Parliament and call a general election. Meanwhile
Victor Emmanuel was wholly engaged with
the peace negotiations, and tried to enlist the influence
of England and France in Sardinia&rsquo;s behalf.
The Delaunay ministry divided on the terms
of peace, and the King was in despair as to whom
he should call upon as steersman in such troubled
seas. He finally turned to Massimo d&rsquo;Azeglio, who
was suffering from a wound he had received at
Vicenza, and who had little taste at any time for
the burdens of premiership. He found it impossible,
however, to refuse his young sovereign at
this hour. He accepted the post, although reluctantly.
Fortunately the views of the King and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
those of D&rsquo;Azeglio coincided on almost all matters.
The King was charmed with D&rsquo;Azeglio&rsquo;s polish and
talents in so many diverse lines; the Minister, much
older than the King, was delighted with Victor
Emmanuel&rsquo;s frank enthusiasms. It was he who
gave the King his proudest title. One day he
remarked, &ldquo;There have been so few honest kings
in the world that it would be a splendid thing to
begin the series.&rdquo; &ldquo;And am I to play the part
of that honest king?&rdquo; asked Victor Emmanuel.
&ldquo;Your majesty has sworn to the constitution,&rdquo;
was the answer, &ldquo;and has taken thought not alone
of Piedmont, but of all Italy. Let us continue in
this path, and hold that a king as well as a private
individual has only one word, and must stand by
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;seems easy to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold then,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Azeglio, &ldquo;we have the
R√® galantuomo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And &ldquo;R√® galantuomo&rdquo; was the name Victor
Emmanuel wrote in the register of the Turin census,
and the title his people were most glad to give
him.</p>

<p>The first months were very troubled, the second
Assembly was captious, and continually in opposition
to the King and his ministers. There were
too many hot-headed representatives of Mazzini&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Young Italy,&rdquo; which, as D&rsquo;Azeglio said, &ldquo;Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
young cannot be expected to have much sense, and
certainly has little.&rdquo; The King fell ill of a fever,
and for a time it seemed possible he might not recover
and that the country would have to endure
a regency during his son&rsquo;s minority. Most providentially
for Italy he did recover, and shortly
after the National Assembly was again dissolved,
and a popular appeal made to the people. The
King issued a royal proclamation which was
heeded by the electors, and as a result of which
more moderate men were sent to the succeeding
Parliament.</p>

<p>The new government boldly took up the question
of whether the clergy were entitled to special
ecclesiastical tribunals under the constitution to
which Victor Emmanuel had just sworn. The ministers
proposed to do away with such courts as
unconstitutional. Immediately the bishops were
up in arms, and a conflict between State and
Church began. The King was besought by his
mother not to oppose the Church, to be a true son
of the Church as his ancestors had been, but Victor
Emmanuel, although always grieved at the need
to oppose the clergy, stood by his ministers. The
Church courts were abolished, and the people, long
tired of ecclesiastical overlorddom, acclaimed King
and ministry as true lovers of liberty.</p>

<p>This firm stand of the new government imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>diately
caused the greatest ill-will on the part of
the Catholic Church, an ill-will which was shown
in a multitude of ways. A member of the ministry,
the Cavalier Santa Rosa, a devout Roman Catholic,
became very ill, and asked his confessor to
administer the sacrament to him. The priest was
forbidden to do this at the express command of
the bishop, and although every effort was made
by Santa Rosa&rsquo;s friends to obtain for him what
he wished, not only did the bishop remain obdurate,
but the curate in attendance actually insulted the
dying man until he was forced to leave the house.
Santa Rosa died without having received the sacrament,
and the history of the event inflamed the
minds of Piedmont more than ever against the
narrowness of the Church. The offending bishop
was imprisoned, and an exchange of notes followed
between Victor Emmanuel and the Pope. The latter
complained of the freedom of speech allowed
by the Sardinian King to his people, and in reply
D&rsquo;Azeglio issued a pamphlet setting forth his
views of the unwarranted assumption of civil authority
by the Church. The death of Santa Rosa
left a vacancy in the ministry which D&rsquo;Azeglio
filled by inviting the Count Camille Cavour to take
the portfolio of Agriculture and Commerce. It
was known that the new man was bold and original,
but not even D&rsquo;Azeglio realized what a commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
spirit he had invited into his official family. The
King alone seems to have gauged Cavour correctly.
&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; he said to D&rsquo;Azeglio, &ldquo;this Cavour
will rule you all, he will dispose of you; he must
become Prime Minister.&rdquo; Fortunate it was for
Italy that the King&rsquo;s prediction was to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Victor Emmanuel, the only constitutional
sovereign in Italy, was bitterly assailed by
the Bourbon rulers. Ferdinand, King of Naples,
once more secure upon his throne, lost no opportunity
to express his disapproval of a king who
was both a nationalist and a liberal. There was
continual friction between Turin and Vienna,
largely because of the outspoken views of the
Piedmontese press with regard to the Austrian
treatment of Lombardy. The European Powers,
with the exception of England, looked upon Piedmont
as an unruly child continually making
trouble. England alone was sincerely friendly to
the House of Savoy, and keenly interested in Victor
Emmanuel&rsquo;s hopes for a united country.</p>

<p>New troubles arose between the Papacy and
Piedmont over the latter&rsquo;s advocacy of a civil marriage
law. D&rsquo;Azeglio and Cavour disagreed, and
the ministry resigned. The King asked D&rsquo;Azeglio
to form a new Cabinet, leaving out Cavour, whom,
he said, &ldquo;we will want later, but not yet.&rdquo; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
new ministry was formed, but only a few months
later D&rsquo;Azeglio, harassed by the trouble with
Rome, and still suffering from his old wound, resigned,
and advised the King to summon Cavour.
Victor Emmanuel hesitated, fearing that Cavour
would push matters forward too fast. When
finally approached, Cavour said that he could not
take office in view of the Church&rsquo;s exorbitant demands,
but he at last consented. The King had
relegated his personal desire not to antagonize
the clergy farther, to his conviction that his country
needed a strong hand at the helm, and, the
decision once made, trusted his new minister
completely.</p>

<p>There were many difficulties to be met. Austria
accused Piedmont of fostering the small revolts
which were continually breaking out in Lombardy,
the war indemnity&mdash;eighty million francs&mdash;was
heavy and had to be raised by new taxation which
was of course universally unpopular. Both at
home and abroad the time was trying, but Victor
Emmanuel found that in Cavour he had a man
who was not afraid of unpopularity, who knew the
art of steering between the radicals and the conservatives,
and who could make use of the politicians
of all the different schools. In Parliament
he could more than hold his own with any opponent,
in his management of foreign affairs he already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
showed that extraordinary diplomatic skill which
at no late day was to win him the reputation of
the first statesman in Europe. Both King and
Minister were imperious by nature, but both
also wise enough to sink their individual wills when
they realized that the cause which they had so
much at heart required it of them. So events led
to the outbreak of the Crimean War.</p>

<p>The steps which led up to Sardinia&rsquo;s alliance
with England and France against Russia belong
to the story of Cavour&rsquo;s diplomacy. Sufficient it
is to say here that Victor Emmanuel was heartily
in favor of the alliance, and would, if he could,
have proceeded to it by more direct means than
Cavour deemed essential. The King was anxious
to redeem the glory of Piedmont&rsquo;s arms, but the
Minister, with his cabinet opposed to him on the
ground that the war was a purely foreign one, had
to consider popular sentiment. Finally, however,
Cavour gave the word that the treaty might be
signed in safety, and the King, his mind made up
long in advance, set his name to the important
document that was to send his army to foreign
battle-fields. The instance was one in which Victor
Emmanuel&rsquo;s firmness of purpose aided and
abetted Cavour&rsquo;s diplomacy. Dabormida resigned
as Foreign Minister, and Cavour immediately took
his post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time the King had heavy burdens
to bear in his immediate family. His mother, to
whom he was devoted, died, bidding him stand fast
by the conservative traditions of his father. His
wife, the beautiful Queen Adelaide, died shortly
afterwards, and the King lost an adviser who had
always counseled him wisely and helpfully, and
whom he had worshiped as an ideal wife and
mother of his sons. Less than a month later his
brother Ferdinand, Duke of Genoa, died, a man
intensely high-spirited and brave, the constant
companion of Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s youth. No wonder
that the King felt that he was left solitary.
He had small time to give to his feelings, however.
&ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that God has struck
me with a judgment, and has torn from me my
mother, my wife, and my brother, because I consented
to those laws, and they threaten me with
greater punishments. But do they not know that
a sovereign who wishes to secure his own happiness
in the other world ought to labor for the happiness
of his people on this earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were more trials immediately in store.
The Church owned more than a tenth part of the
landed property of Piedmont, and the religious
houses were extravagantly wealthy. The government,
planning reforms, decided that some modification
of this condition must be made, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Rattazzi, then Minister of Grace and Justice,
introduced his bill for the suppression of certain
of the religious houses and other similar reforms.
Immediately the bishops and the conservatives
were up in arms, and Victor Emmanuel had to
bear the brunt of an attack which proclaimed him
an infidel, an enemy of religion, and which predicted
the direst punishments to him should he
persist in his course. The ministry were firm,
however, and the people were with them. Certain
bishops offered to pay over the amount which
would be derived from the suppression of the
religious houses, and the offer was tempting to
the King, who could not forget his mother&rsquo;s
wishes, and the close ties that bound his house to
Rome. A breach with his ministers followed, and
the King sought counsel of his own subjects and
of the French and English envoys. All advised
him to trust the decision to Cavour. Finally he
did so, and the Rattazzi measure, somewhat modified,
became law.</p>

<p>The Sardinian army meantime was winning victories
in the Crimea, and La Marmora was proving
himself a match for the great generals of the
allied Powers. The thought of his troops was the
King&rsquo;s one solace at this time, which was so trying
to him both personally and politically. He was
passionately fond of military glory, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
have preferred the opportunity to lead his soldiers
to any gift fortune could have bestowed. The
soldiers knew this, the people were growing more
and more attached to their &ldquo;R√® galantuomo,&rdquo; and
the King, always quickly touched by the affection
of his people, grew stronger in his resolve never to
dim their hopes of him. He said of his uncle, the
Grand Duke of Tuscany, who was ruling according
to the accepted code of an Austrian Prince,
&ldquo;How could he, by his own act, sacrifice the affections
of his people? If I reigned over not a little
state like Piedmont, but over an empire vast as
America, and had to do what he has done to
preserve the little throne of Tuscany, I would
not hesitate a moment, I would renounce the
empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In order that France and England might learn
to know the true Victor Emmanuel from the false
one created by the slanders of the clerical party,
the King, accompanied by Cavour and D&rsquo;Azeglio,
in December, 1855, visited Paris and London. In
both cities he was warmly greeted, and made much
of, and as he was about to leave the French capital
Napoleon asked the significant question, &ldquo;What
can I do for Italy?&rdquo; England gave the King the
welcome she has always in store for the hero who
is fighting despotic claims, and the brief visit gave
the statesmen and people the opportunity to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
openly the warmth of their regard for Italy. Victor
Emmanuel and Cavour were both known to
have great admiration for the English government,
and a liking for English characteristics
which was common to most leading Italians of the
time. December 11 the King returned to Turin,
to be welcomed by his people with the warmest expressions
of affectionate regard.</p>

<p>The fall of Sebastopol brought the war in the
Crimea to a close, and led to the Congress at Paris
in 1856. The result of that Congress was one of
the signal triumphs of Cavour. He succeeded in
introducing a general discussion of Italian affairs,
and in placing Victor Emmanuel in the position of
champion of all the subject Italian states, a position
which, once so publicly assumed, he never
afterwards gave over. The King showed the
deepest gratitude to his great Minister on the latter&rsquo;s
return from the Congress, and realized that
through his diplomacy affairs were rapidly being
shaped towards a new conclusion of strength with
Austria. Soon afterwards the Sardinian army returned
from the Crimea, and the King welcomed
them home as heroes who had yet greater triumphs
in store for them, and linked the general who had
led them, Alfonzo La Marmora, with Cavour as
the two chief agents in his rising hopes.</p>

<p>King and Minister had many obstacles to over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>come
during those years of waiting that were more
difficult to surmount successfully than actual battles
of armies or statesmen. Austria and the
Church lost no opportunity to direct public sentiment
against Sardinia, the revolutionary element,
led by men whose fiery ardor never cooled, were
continually urging the government at Turin to
attack the Austrians in Lombardy, the other states
were turbulent and continually in trouble with
their Princes, and the people looked to Victor
Emmanuel as their preserver and the Princes upon
him as their arch enemy. Moreover at this time
England, doubtful of French sincerity, entered
into an alliance with Austria, and shortly after
the Italian, Felice Orsini, made an attempt on the
life of Louis Napoleon. Fortunately neither event
had as disastrous results to Piedmont&rsquo;s hopes as
many predicted, the Anglo-Austrian alliance
proved lukewarm, and Orsini&rsquo;s appeal to Napoleon
to succor Italy touched a responsive chord in the
French Emperor&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>As the ten years&rsquo; armistice with Austria drew
to a close, Victor Emmanuel found reason to believe
that the day was not far distant when he
should have his chance to redeem Novara. Napoleon
and Cavour had reached a tacit agreement in
July, 1858, at Plombi√®res. When Parliament
opened in 1859 the King made his memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
speech from the throne, including in it the words
long and carefully considered by Cavour, &ldquo;While
we respect treaties, we are not insensible to the
cry of anguish that comes up to us from many
parts of Italy.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;<i>grido di dolore</i>,&rdquo;
cry of anguish, became famous forthwith. An
eye-witness of the scene, the Neapolitan Massari,
thus describes it: &ldquo;At every period the speech
was interrupted by clamorous applause, and cries
of &lsquo;Viva il R√®!&rsquo; But when he came to the words
<i>grido di dolore</i>, there was an enthusiasm quite indescribable.
Senators, deputies, spectators, all
sprang to their feet with a bound, and broke into
passionate acclamations. The ministers of France,
Russia, Prussia, and England were utterly astonished
and carried away by the marvelous spectacle.
The face of the Ambassador of Naples was
covered with a gloomy pallor. We poor exiles did
not even attempt to wipe away the tears that
flowed copiously, unrestrainedly from our eyes, as
we frantically clapped our hands in applause of
that King who had remembered our sorrows, who
had promised us a country. Before the victories,
the plebiscites, and the annexations conferred on
him the crown of Italy, he reigned in our hearts;
he was our King!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speech was like a war-cry to patriots
throughout Italy, and no sooner were its tidings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
known than men of all ranks flocked to Piedmont,
weapons in hand, in order to be ready when the
great hour should strike. Meantime Victor Emmanuel
had to make two sacrifices as the price of
French alliance in case of an Austrian war, he had
to consent to the marriage of his daughter
Clotilde, then about sixteen, with the French
Emperor&rsquo;s cousin, Prince Napoleon Jerome, a man
more than twice her age. The King was very
loath to agree to the marriage, it required the
strongest of Cavour&rsquo;s arguments to induce him to
consent. Finally, however, he did. &ldquo;You have
convinced me of the political reasons which render
this marriage useful and necessary to our cause.
I yield to your arguments, but I make a sacrifice in
so doing. My consent is subject to the condition
that my daughter gives hers freely.&rdquo; Having
won over the father, Cavour succeeded in winning
over the daughter, and the marriage was solemnized
on January 29, 1859.</p>

<p>The second sacrifice to France, one which was
considered at this time but not made until later,
was the cession of Nice and Savoy. This was a
hard concession for the King to make, for Savoy
was the first home of his family, and linked by the
closest ties to the traditions of his house. He was
willing, however, to make even this sacrifice for the
liberation of northern Italy, all he wanted now was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the chance to loose his soldiers and place himself
at their head. Still his advisers counseled patience.
&ldquo;We must wait, sire,&rdquo; said General Neil.
&ldquo;I have been waiting for ten years, general,&rdquo; was
the King&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the King&rsquo;s spirits, he was not
to be forced to wait much longer. A European
Congress for the adjustment of Italian difficulties
was planned, and the notes of the various governments
in reference thereto gave Cavour the chance
he wanted. He insisted that Sardinia should be
admitted to the Congress on an equal footing with
the Powers, but this Austria opposed. The Court
of Vienna insisted that Sardinia should only be
allowed to treat of the question of disarmament.
Then Austria insisted that Sardinia be made to
disarm immediately. This would have caused the
gravest setback to Piedmont&rsquo;s hopes, but when
England came forward with the suggestion that
Austria as well as Sardinia disarm, the King at
Turin and his minister felt that they must consent.
Fortune favored them, they had no sooner agreed
to the English proposals than Austrian envoys arrived
at Turin with an ultimatum, immediate disarmament
or war, a decision to be given in three
days. Thus Austria became the aggressor, and
Napoleon&rsquo;s promise to aid Piedmont in such case
fell due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>A refusal to accept the Austrian terms was
given to the envoys, and on April 23 the Sardinian
Parliament ordered that the troops start
for Lombardy and confided the supreme command
to Victor Emmanuel. He issued a royal proclamation,
commencing, &ldquo;Austria assails us with a
powerful army, which, while simulating a desire
for peace, she had collected for our injury in the
unhappy provinces subject to her domination,&rdquo;
and concluding, &ldquo;We confide in God and in our
concord; we confide in the valor of the Italian soldiers,
in the alliance of the noble French nation;
we confide in the justice of public opinion. I
have no other ambition than to be the first soldier
of Italian Independence. Viva l&rsquo;Italia!&mdash;Victor
Emmanuel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Italy shall be!&rdquo; Victor Emmanuel had sworn
on the field of Novara ten years before; now, with
all the ardor restrained during those long years of
waiting, he flamed to make his promise true. He
was an heroic figure as he reviewed his troops at
Alessandria, he was some king of the Middle Ages
to whom horse and arms were incomparably dearer
than pomp and ease at home. He said that he
should lead his troops in battle, and he did,
proving himself so absolutely reckless of safety
that both generals and soldiers were constantly
alarmed. Yet it was that same wild recklessness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of his which made his soldiers fight as they did;
they saw that their King was never afraid to face
what he commanded them to face.</p>

<p>The French Emperor landed at Genoa May 13,
1859, amid loud Italian plaudits, and the two sovereigns
set out together for the field of war. Napoleon
the Third had many shortcomings, and
Italians scarcely knew whether to bless or curse
him in those years when he played so large a part
in their history, but he did have the art of inspiring
warm and lasting friendships, and Victor
Emmanuel, whose nature was always open to admiration
for those about him, had known him but
a short time before he gave him the deepest and
sincerest personal trust.</p>

<p>The war opened auspiciously for Piedmont, the
people of Lombardy were all in arms, Garibaldi
was waging irregular warfare through the Lakes
with his band of volunteers called the &ldquo;Hunters of
the Alps,&rdquo; and the allied Italian and French
armies carried off their first battles with the Austrians.
May 20 was fought the battle of Montebello,
and shortly afterwards the battle of Palestro,
long drawn out, but ultimately victorious for
the allies. On the last day of the battle it seemed
that the Austrians must win; the Italian troops,
fighting desperately and falling in numbers, were
almost outflanked and surrounded when the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Zouaves suddenly appeared, and with terrific fire
drove the Austrians back and seized their cannon.
Victor Emmanuel led the furious charge that followed,
and was so impetuous that both Italians
and Zouaves were continually alarmed lest he
should be cut off from them. When the battle
ended the Zouaves elected King Victor their captain,
declaring that he was the first of all true
Zouaves because he would not listen to reason.</p>

<p>On June 4 the great battle of Magenta was won
by the allies, and the memory of Novara was obliterated
in this overwhelming triumph which freed
Lombardy from Austria. Immediately a Lombard
delegation came to the King of Sardinia and
offered him the fealty of their state and asked for
its union with Piedmont. Thus came the first new
state into united Italy.</p>

<p>On June 8 the allies entered Milan, the Lombard
capital, and celebrated their victories with
a splendid service at the cathedral. Meanwhile
news arrived of a French victory at Melegnano,
and of Garibaldi&rsquo;s daring movements among the
Alps. The Lombards were beside themselves with
delight, the Austrians, so long their overlords,
had at last withdrawn across the Mincio into Venetia.
Victor Emmanuel issued a proclamation in
Milan on June 9 in which occurred the stirring
words of praise for his ally so often quoted, &ldquo;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Emperor of the French, our generous ally, worthy
of the name and genius of Napoleon, putting himself
at the head of the heroic army of that great
nation, wishes <i>to liberate Italy from the Alps to
the Adriatic</i>. In a rivalry of sacrifices you will
second these magnanimous proposals on the field of
battle, you will show yourselves worthy of the destinies
to which Italy is now called after so many
centuries of suffering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Milan the King first met Garibaldi, whose
reputation for striking audacity and no less remarkable
simplicity had made a strong appeal to a
sovereign who could appreciate those qualities.
Here their friendship began, a mutual admiration
which was to be the strongest link to bind the general,
growing yearly more and more a republican,
to the future Kingdom of Italy.</p>

<p>Austria was now ready for a new attack, and
appeared suddenly in front of the allied armies.
The latter met them, and fought on June 24 the
great battle called Solferino by the French, and
San Martino by the Italians. San Martino is the
name of a hill which commands the roads to the
Lake of Garda. The Piedmontese had held it at
first, but were dislodged by the Austrians. Then
re-enforcements arrived, and the height was retaken,
but at great cost. The King sent an officer
to the general in command, saying, &ldquo;Our allies are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
winning a great battle at Solferino; it is the
King&rsquo;s wish that his soldiers should win one at
San Martino.&rdquo; &ldquo;Say to the King that his orders
shall be executed,&rdquo; replied General Mollard. The
King succeeded in capturing Sonato, and then
went to the defense of San Martino, which was
finally won after most desperate fighting. The
Italians had equaled the proud record of their
allies on that day. Between them the two armies
had driven the Austrians completely out of Lombardy.
That night it did not seem unlikely that
a few more weeks would indeed see Italy free from
the Alps to the Adriatic, and Venice united to her
sister cities of the north.</p>

<p>Napoleon, having met with the most unqualified
success in Italy, suddenly stopped short, and proceeded,
almost as though panic-stricken, to ask
Austria for an armistice, as though he were the
vanquished, not the victor. Both Italians and
Frenchmen heard of this determination of the Emperor
first with incredulity, then with amazement,
then with indignation. Victor Emmanuel did his
utmost to induce his ally to change his intention,
but Napoleon was obdurate. Then the King, who
realized to the full what a crushing blow this step
would be to the soaring hopes of the Italian cities,
resigned himself to the situation as best he could.
&ldquo;Poor Italy!&rdquo; he said to the French Emperor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
&ldquo;Whatever shall be your Majesty&rsquo;s decision I shall
always feel grateful for what you have done for
Italian independence, and you may count on me
as a friend.&rdquo; It must have been hard for a king
who saw his victorious army checked in mid-career
to have spoken such dignified words.</p>

<p>Other men did not take Napoleon&rsquo;s action with
any such restraint. The men of the provinces who
had seen themselves almost free of the yoke they so
deeply hated were indescribably bitter at this outcome,
Garibaldi and his volunteers felt themselves
confirmed in that antipathy to Napoleon they had
been at small pains to conceal, and the general was
only calmed by the personal appeal of his King.
But the effect was most disastrous upon Cavour,
who had labored to bring about this war as no
other man in Italy had done, and who now believed
that the tremendous efforts of his life had gone
for nothing. He had shouldered tremendous responsibility,
now he felt the disaster overwhelmingly.
He hurried to the King&rsquo;s camp, and making
small effort to conceal his anger, denounced
the Emperor and counseled the King to refuse to
accept Lombardy under the terms of peace. Positions
were reversed, for the moment Victor Emmanuel
was the calm statesman looking to the
future, Cavour the man of fiery impulse who would
accept no compromise. The meeting was long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
difficult, and when Cavour left, having placed his
resignation in the King&rsquo;s hands, there was a deep
breach between the two men. Cavour returned to
Turin, &ldquo;in the space of three days grown older
by many years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Treaty of Villafranca was signed July 12,
1859, and by it Lombardy was joined to Piedmont.
The Cavour ministry only held office until their
successors could be appointed. Rattazzi at last
agreed to accept the helm.</p>

<p>The high contracting parties to the treaty had
thought that they could dispose of the small Italian
states as they pleased, and return them to the
dominion of their Grand Dukes and Princes by a
stroke of the pen. It proved, however, quite otherwise.
Modena, Parma, the provinces of Bologna,
Ferrara, Umbria, Perugia, and the Marches, had
been too near freedom to suffer the peaceful return
of their old overlords. State after state had sent
deputations to the Sardinian King during the war
asking for annexation to Piedmont, and some of
them had provisional governments with Piedmontese
deputies at their head. The ministry at Turin
gave orders in pursuance of the terms of peace
withdrawing the royal commissioners, but the men
in charge felt that they could not abandon their
posts and leave the people in a state bordering on
anarchy, and the people stated decisively that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
would not allow their fugitive Princes to return.
So the Treaty of Villafranca was not as effective
as its makers had intended it to be.</p>

<p>The central Italian states proceeded to take
affairs into their own hands, and sent envoys to the
different courts of Europe to represent the true
conditions in their respective cities and their
ardent desire for annexation to Piedmont. In
Florence Ricasoli, in Modena Farini took positive
stands, and led in the calling of an Assembly of all
the smaller states, which resolved that they would
become subjects of the Sardinian King. Deputation
after deputation came to the King at
Turin, composed of the best known men of the
states, and besought him to accept their allegiance.
It was a difficult position for the King. He could
not refuse requests so ardently made, and which
represented the dearest wish of people he had so
often declared he would protect, yet he could not
easily accept in view of the position of Austria and
France. He welcomed the envoys warmly, entertained
them at his capital, and spoke to them
freely, assuring them of the warmth of his desires
and asking them to be patient only a little time
longer. In November, 1859, the Powers saw that
a conference must meet to consider this problem
of Italy. Piedmont looked about for the man to
speak her voice, and only one man was thought of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
The King had felt Cavour&rsquo;s anger deeply, and
could hardly find it in him to call him out of his
retirement. He saw, however, that any Congress
would be useless without the great statesman, and
so he finally consented, and nominated him as first
Sardinian plenipotentiary.</p>

<p>Although the King could bring himself to appoint
Cavour, the Rattazzi ministry were unwilling
to have him act, and it seemed as though no compromise
could be effected. Cavour was asked to
put his conditions of acceptance in writing, and
by chance happened to dictate them to Sir James
Hudson, the British Minister at Turin, with whom
he was staying. When the conditions were received
by the cabinet the ministers did not favor
them, and La Marmora, discovering them to be in
Sir James Hudson&rsquo;s handwriting, was offended at
what he chose to consider foreign interference,
and resigned. The cabinet, never very strong,
could not stand, and the King at once pocketed his
last dislike, and summoned Cavour to form a new
ministry. This the Count consented to do.</p>

<p>The Pope was much alarmed at the condition
of the Papal States and began publicly to denounce
Victor Emmanuel for encouraging both
those and the other states in their desire for annexation.
The correspondence between Pope and
King was most remarkable, always dignified, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
on the King&rsquo;s part breathing the desire for reconciliation,
but on the Pope&rsquo;s indignant and alarming.
The proposed European Congress did not
meet, and as month after month passed events
showed that the central states would have their
way. At length these states took a formal vote in
popular assemblies, and declared unanimously for
annexation with Piedmont. The King could withstand
them no longer, and the annexation was
agreed to. Immediately Pius IX. issued a bull of
excommunication against Victor Emmanuel, his
ministers, soldiers, and subjects, and proclaimed
him no better than a sacrilegious robber. This
act, formerly so terrifying, had no effect, the people
had made up their minds, and in the spring of
1860 the King received Farini, Dictator of Emilia,
and Ricasoli, Dictator of Tuscany, and accepted
from them the allegiance of central Italy.</p>

<p>That France might take no untoward step at
sight of a kingdom growing so rapidly on her
southern border Victor Emmanuel had to make the
second concession to Napoleon, and cede Savoy and
Nice. It was a bitter step for the head of the
House of Savoy to take, but he felt that the need
of Italy required it of him, and, as with every
other sacrifice that need required of him, he met it
resolutely. Not so Garibaldi, who saw his birthplace
given to a foreign Power; he never forgave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Cavour that act, and it widened the gulf already
separating them.</p>

<p>The new Parliament met on April 2, 1860,
numbering among its members the greatest names
of Piedmont, Lombardy, Tuscany, and Emilia.
Ricasoli, Farini, Capponi, Manzoni, Mamiani,
Poerio, all had seats. The King, in his speech
from the throne, dwelt upon the accession of central
Italy, and briefly but with infinite pathos
stated that he had made a treaty for the reunion
of Savoy and Nice to France. Then he called his
hearers&rsquo; minds to the work that lay before them.
&ldquo;In turning our attention,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;to
the new ordering of affairs, not seeking in old
parties other than the memory of the services rendered
to the common cause, we invite all sincere
opinions to a noble emulation that we may attain
the grand end of the greatness of the country. It
is no longer the Italy of the Romans, nor that of
the Middle Ages; it must no longer be the battle-field
of ambitious foreigners, but it must be rather
the Italy of the Italians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How many patriots had voiced that cry &ldquo;the
Italy of the Italians&rdquo; through the long centuries
when Goth and Vandal, Guelph and Ghibelline,
Pope and Emperor, France and Austria, had
striven to gain the upper hand in the Peninsula!</p>

<p>Soon after Parliament opened the King made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
tour of his new possessions, and was hailed in each
city as deliverer. The joy of the people in the
thought that at last they had an Italian prince in
place of the fickle, foreign-bred Bourbons, was
wonderful to behold: &ldquo;At last we are eleven million
Italians!&rdquo; was their proud cry. Florence
received the King with decorations of every fashion,
arches of triumph, houses draped with the tricolor
and rich brocades, streets carpeted with
laurels, a rain of roses as he rode from the railway
station to the Palazzo Vecchio. The greatest
men of Tuscany, poets, artists, musicians,
scholars, came to greet him, and with one accord
proclaimed him the hero who had brought to fruition
the dreams of their lives. His visit to
Florence was a memorable one.</p>

<p>We must now glance for a moment at the remarkable
events which General Garibaldi was
bringing to pass in Sicily and Calabria. The expedition
of the Thousand had started from Genoa,
openly disavowed by that astute diplomat Cavour,
secretly encouraged by him. The hero of the
magic Red Shirt had swept over Sicily and crossed
thence to the mainland. Men of all classes were
speeding from every part of Italy to fight under
such a glorious leader, the triumphal march from
Reggio to Naples had begun, and the troops of
Francis II. of Naples were proving how very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
they had the interest of their sovereign&rsquo;s cause at
heart. But with Garibaldi in possession of Naples
serious questions arose. The victorious general
wished to march immediately on Rome, and to hold
the dictatorship of southern Italy until he could
unite it in one gift to Victor Emmanuel. It was
an heroic desire, worthy of its great inventor, but
Victor Emmanuel and Cavour both realized that
a march on Rome at that time meant the active
intervention of French troops, and that a prolonged
dictatorship might give the republican element
an opportunity to change Garibaldi&rsquo;s plans
and destroy the hope of national unity. There
were numbers of Mazzinians in Naples and Cavour
feared their influence over the great crusader. He
appealed to Parliament, and it voted for the immediate
annexation of Naples and Sicily. Then the
royal army was sent at the double quick to meet
Garibaldi before he should start for Rome. When
the army was well on its march Cavour gave this
note to the foreign ambassadors in explanation:
&ldquo;If we do not arrive on the Volturno before Garibaldi
arrives at Cattolica, the monarchy is lost&mdash;Italy
remains a prey to revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King led the royal army south and the
progress through the Papal States was one continual
triumph; General Cialdini met the Papal
army at Castelfidardo and defeated them, soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
after he took Ancona, and Victor Emmanuel was
in possession of Umbria, the Marches, and Perugia,
all taken as Cavour diplomatically explained,
to save Italy from revolution.</p>

<p>Garibaldi generously acquiesced in the decision
of the Parliament at Turin, and prepared to surrender
his conquests to the King. As Victor Emmanuel
started from Ancona on the last stage of
his progress to Naples he issued an address to the
people of southern Italy, which concluded, &ldquo;My
troops advance among you to maintain order; I
do not come to impose my will upon you, but to see
that yours is respected. You will be able to manifest
it freely. That Providence which protects
just causes will guide the vote which you will place
upon the urn. Whatever be the gravity of the
events which may arise, I await tranquilly the
judgment of civilized Europe and of history, because
I have the consciousness of having fulfilled
my duty as King and as an Italian. In Europe
my policy perhaps will not be without effect in
helping to reconcile the progress of the people with
the stability of the monarchy. In Italy I know
that I close the era of revolutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside of Naples the King at the head of his
troops was met by Garibaldi, riding with some of
his red-shirted officers. Garibaldi saluted Victor
Emmanuel as &ldquo;King of Italy,&rdquo; and the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
thanked him with simple words. Then they
clasped hands and rode side by side towards the
capital, which the general was giving to the King.
Each of the men was then and always, even in the
dismal days of Aspromonte and Mentana, a warm
admirer of the other. November 7, 1860, Victor
Emmanuel entered Naples, which was given over
to triumphal acclamations of King and general.
They reigned side by side as popular idols for some
days, and then Garibaldi, refusing all gifts and
honors, returned to his island of Caprera, and
Victor Emmanuel soon afterwards returned to his
capital of Turin.</p>

<p>The last strongholds of the Bourbons in Italy
fell early in the new year, and the nation lacked
only Rome and Venetia for completion. A new
Parliament was called at Turin to mark the transition
from the Kingdom of Sardinia to the Kingdom
of Italy. Representatives of all the new provinces
appeared, and Parliament was opened on
February 18, 1861. The King, in his speech
from the throne, reviewed the great events of the
past year, and declared that the valor of the great
medi√¶val cities of Italy had been shown to survive
in the sons of the modern kingdom. He was proclaimed
the sovereign by the title of Victor Emmanuel
II., by the Grace of God and by the will of
the nation, King of Italy. He chose that his pred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>ecessor
of the same name should bear the title of
the first Victor Emmanuel, but he was only King
of Sardinia, and this sovereign was in fact Victor
Emmanuel the First of Italy.</p>

<p>Cavour decided to resign and so allow the new
King the opportunity to appoint a new Premier.
The will of the King had occasionally clashed with
the will of the statesman, and the former now hesitated
in the matter of choosing his new Prime
Minister. He conferred with the leaders of the
various provinces, and found them all in one accord,
Cavour must be the first minister of Italy.
He was invited to form a new ministry, and agreed
to do so. Attacked at home by Garibaldi and
those who wished to take Rome by the sword, and
vilified abroad by Papal emissaries, the great Minister
heeded neither party, but proceeded quietly
to lay his plans for the ultimate acquisition of
Rome as the national capital. As always, he believed
in alternating audacity with patience, and
believed that this was the time for the exercise of
the latter virtue.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the course of Italian history,
Cavour&rsquo;s labors to induce the Catholic world to
have faith in his belief that a free church in a free
state was best for civilization were brought to a
close that spring. He died June 6, 1861, having
worked so hard in Parliament that he had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
upon himself a violent fever. The King had
visited him on June 5, and the sick man had roused
sufficiently to speak to him. &ldquo;Ah, Maest√†!&rdquo;
murmured the man, to whom Victor Emmanuel
represented the central figure of his career. At
Cavour&rsquo;s death Victor Emmanuel was prostrated.
&ldquo;Better for Italy if it were I who had died!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, with full consciousness that it had been
Cavour who alone of all Italians had possessed the
greatness of intellect to raise the throne of Piedmont
to an equality among the Powers.</p>

<p>All Italians felt that their greatest guide was
lost to them in Cavour&rsquo;s death. Only at this time
did they fully realize how monumental had been
his force of character, how simple and endearing
his nature. For years he had silently shouldered
burdens of inestimable weight, and followed his
course in the face of attack both at home and
abroad. Massimo d&rsquo;Azeglio wrote to Farini,
&ldquo;Poor Cavour. It is only now I know how much I
loved him. I am no longer good for anything, but
I have prayed to heaven for our country, and a
gleam of comfort has come to me. If God <i>will</i> He
<i>can</i> save Italy even without Cavour.&rdquo; There were
many men in Italy who felt that only by miracle
now could their fragile ship be brought safely into
port.</p>

<p>From the date of Cavour&rsquo;s death Victor Em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>manuel
gave more personal concern to the foreign
affairs of his country, he felt that his responsibilities
had tremendously increased. Ricasoli, who
had been dictator of Florence, became Prime Minister.
England and France had acknowledged
the new Kingdom of Italy, and now Prussia and
Russia did likewise. A marriage was arranged
between Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s youngest daughter
Maria Pia and the King of Portugal, and the
various countries of Europe all turned with a new
interest to the romantic history of the fast-spreading
House of Savoy.</p>

<p>The burdens that Cavour had borne so long soon
proved too heavy for his successor Ricasoli, and
after nine months&rsquo; service he resigned his office.
Rattazzi, Cavour&rsquo;s old ally in the early days of
Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s reign, succeeded him as Prime
Minister. He it was who now had to face the increasing
complications of the Roman question
brought about by the determination of Garibaldi
and the ardent spirits of &ldquo;Young Italy&rdquo; to take
the Papal capital by storm. Cavour had been
able, in part at least, to prevent friction between
the regular army and the Garibaldians, and to
guide the impulsive general. Whether he could
have prevented Garibaldi from embarking again
from Sicily, this time headed for Rome, no one
can say. Rattazzi found the task beyond him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>In midsummer of 1862 Garibaldi and his volunteers
crossed from Sicily and took up their
march through Calabria with the motto of their
endeavor, &ldquo;Rome or death.&rdquo; The Italian government
felt that the advance must be stopped at
all costs, or they would be involved in foreign warfare.
General Cialdini was sent to oppose Garibaldi,
and did so at Aspromonte, where, after a
very short resistance, the volunteers surrendered.
Unfortunately Garibaldi was wounded in the foot,
and the illness that followed was long and trying
both to the general and to the Italian government.
The wounded hero was lionized and acclaimed, and
treated more like a martyr than an insurgent.
The King was bitterly grieved at the tragedy of
Aspromonte, and the necessity of taking prisoner
a man who had labored so valiantly for Italian
freedom.</p>

<p>The Rattazzi Ministry could not withstand the
loss of popular support after Aspromonte, and resigned.
Farini, who had been dictator of Emilia
in the days following the last Austrian war, succeeded
Rattazzi as Premier, but he in turn was
soon forced by ill-health to surrender the control.
Minghetti then became Prime Minister. Meantime
the Roman question was as far from being
settled as ever; Napoleon, protesting that he was
the friend of Italian independence, yet in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
breath insisting on the temporal dominion of the
Pope, proving an insurmountable obstacle. Fortunately
for Italy the time was to come when
Napoleon&rsquo;s attention would be wholly directed elsewhere.
In these days of indecision and waiting
Victor Emmanuel traveled extensively through all
parts of the kingdom, and was everywhere greeted
with the warmest evidence of gratitude and affection.
Italians were not used to a sovereign who
was glad to meet all classes of his people, and not
afraid to hear their views of his government. His
fearlessness, his devotion, his bonhomie all endeared
him to the people, and the R√® Galantuomo became
indeed a very honest king to all men who had only
known Austrian and clerical governors.</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel expected that Venice would be
added to the Kingdom of Italy before Rome was,
but the immediate annexation of neither seemed
probable. The French government became gradually
more conciliatory, but the changes were very
gradual. Napoleon foresaw that Rome must inevitably
become Italy&rsquo;s capital, and the French
minister, Druyn de Lhuys, said, &ldquo;Of course in
the end you will go to Rome. But it is important
that between our evacuation and your going there,
such an interval of time elapse as to prevent people
establishing any connection between the two facts;
France must not have any responsibility.&rdquo; Napo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>leon
proposed that the Italian capital be moved
from Turin to a southern and more central city,
and the Minghetti Ministry accepted the suggestion
and proposed to the King that the seat of
government be transferred to Florence. The
thought of leaving Turin, for so many centuries
the home of his family, caused Victor Emmanuel
the greatest distress. &ldquo;You know I am a true
Turinese,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and no one can understand
what a wrench it is to my heart to think that I
must abandon this city where I have so many affections,
where there is such a feeling of fidelity to
my family, where the bones of my fathers and all
my dear ones repose.&rdquo; It appeared, however, that
the change must be made if the advantages of the
new agreement with France, according to which
the French troops were to evacuate Rome in two
years, were to be obtained. &ldquo;Since the cession of
Savoy and Nice,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;no public event
has cost me such bitter regret. If I were not persuaded
that this sacrifice is necessary to the unity
of Italy I would refuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turin, when it heard of the determination of
the government, gave itself over to consternation
of the wildest type. The Minghetti Ministry had
to resign, and even the beloved King was not spared
open demonstration of his people&rsquo;s disapproval.
He summoned General La Marmora to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Premier, and the new minister carried the change
through in spite of Turinese disapproval. The
change was made early in 1865, and Florence welcomed
the King with every tribute of honor. It
was some time, however, before Victor Emmanuel
could forget the injustice done him by the people
of his own city, although they later proved their
regret for their unkind treatment by asking forgiveness
and celebrating his visits to them with
unwonted joy.</p>

<p>Early in 1866 the King&rsquo;s third son, Otto, Duke
of Monferrat, who had long been an invalid, died,
and at very nearly the same time died that remarkable
man, Massimo d&rsquo;Azeglio. From the days of
his early youth the King had relied on the counsels
and wise judgment of this man, who was alternately
artist, poet, statesman, soldier, and who
had the gift of making friends to a greater degree
than any Italian in public life. He had sacrificed
his own interests time and again at the request of
his King or of Cavour, he had traveled throughout
Italy studying conditions in the days of
Charles Albert, and recording them in his books,
he had been honored by almost all the sovereigns
of Europe as a man of the noblest character and
highest talents. His death was a great loss to
Italy.</p>

<p>The clouds of war were gathering abroad in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
that same year. Prussia and Austria were quarreling,
and the Italian government concluded an
alliance with Prussia on April 8, 1866. Austria,
realizing that she would have sufficient difficulty in
holding her own against Prussia without having to
guard against her southern neighbor also, made
overtures through Napoleon agreeing to cede
Venetia to Italy if that country would dissolve its
alliance with Prussia. The temptation was
strong, but the King and his Prime Minister refused
to break their engagements, and on June 20,
1866, declared war against Austria. Victor Emmanuel
appointed his cousin Regent, and took command
of his troops. The two young Princes,
Humbert and Amadeus, went with him.</p>

<p>On that same field of Custozza, where the Italians
had lost in 1849, the armies met, and after a
long and bloody battle the army of Italy was
again worsted. At the same time the Italian fleet
was beaten at Lissa in the Adriatic. Even Garibaldi&rsquo;s
volunteers in the Lakes were not meeting
with their former successes, and the campaign
would have been disastrous to Italian hopes had
not their ally, Prussia, forced Austria to immediate
terms by the two great victories of K√∂niggratz
and Sadowa. An armistice followed, and
Napoleon, to whom Austria ceded Venetia, gave
that province to Italy with the approval of Prus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>sia.
The Italians were dejected by their losses,
but at least Venice was finally free from the
foreigner.</p>

<p>The beautiful city of the Adriatic was no sooner
free than she sent her foremost citizens to Victor
Emmanuel to ask for immediate annexation to the
Italian kingdom. It was a glorious day when the
red, white, and green flag was raised in Saint
Mark&rsquo;s Square, and the Venetian heroes, exiled
with their great leader, Daniel Manin, almost two
decades earlier, could return to breathe the air
of their beloved home. Victor Emmanuel received
the citizens of Venice at Turin, and answered their
eager desire with stirring words. &ldquo;Citizens of
Venice,&rdquo; so ran his answer, &ldquo;this is the most beautiful
day of my life. It is now nineteen years
since my father proclaimed from this city the war
of national independence. To-day, his birthday,
you, gentlemen, bring me the evidence of the popular
will of the Venetian provinces, which we now
unite to the great Italian nation, declaring as an
accomplished fact the desire of my august parent.
You confirm by this solemn act that which Venetia
did in 1848, and which she maintained with such
admirable constancy and self-abnegation. Let
me here pay a tribute to those brave men who with
their blood, and with sacrifices of every sort, kept
undiminished faith to their country and to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
destinies. With this day shall disappear from the
Peninsula every vestige of foreign domination.
Italy is made, if not completed; it now rests
with the Italians to make her great and prosperous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, the Iron Crown is also restored in
this solemn day to Italy. But above this crown I
place that which to me is dearer&mdash;the crown of my
people&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>November 7, 1866, the King made his formal
entry into that most beautiful of the rare group
of Italy&rsquo;s cities, and the one which had belonged
most absolutely to the foreigner.</p>

<p>Rome alone now remained outside the nation,
and it was plainly only a matter of time before
Pius IX. would have to submit to his evident destiny.
The French had kept their agreement, and
were leaving Rome, the call of the Romans to Victor
Emmanuel to come and free them grew ever
louder, and the wish of the Italian people grew
daily more pronounced. It was Victor Emmanuel
himself who would not force the Church&rsquo;s hand,
he was content to wait, knowing how events were
gradually shaping, and this patience of his in the
end proved its wisdom.</p>

<p>There were others, however, who would not wait,
and these were the Garibaldians. When the
Romans found that the King would not draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
sword to free them, they turned to the crusader
whose hand was always on his sword hilt at the call
of Rome. He heard the call now, took the field
again, and placed his King a second time in the
same unenviable position.</p>

<p>One ministry resigned, no statesman seemed
competent to cope with the situation which Garibaldi
was bringing on his country, the King saw
Italy on the brink of civil war, and was at the same
time fearful lest the French troops return and
destroy the volunteers. It was the most trying
time in his career as King of Italy.</p>

<p>Garibaldi was arrested, imprisoned at Caprera,
escaped, and joined the now rapidly increasing
volunteers in the country about Rome. He met
with success at the battle of Monte Rotondo, but a
few days later found his army opposed at Mentana
by French troops which Napoleon had hurriedly
sent to protect the Papal temporal power.
The French were armed with the new chassepot
gun, and the Garibaldians were defeated with terrible
loss. They could not renew the unequal
struggle, and the brief campaign came to an untimely
end.</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel was heart-broken at the news
of the frightful havoc at Mentana and the Garibaldian
losses. &ldquo;Ah, those chassepots!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;They have mortally wounded my heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
as father and king. I feel as if the balls had torn
my flesh. It is one of the greatest griefs that I
have ever known in all my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the short campaign the reckless patriot
Garibaldi was again imprisoned, but soon released.
He had proved a tremendous problem to all the
successors of Cavour. He returned to Caprera,
and gradually the agitation of the Roman question
subsided into its former slow and diplomatic
course.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince Humbert, who was twenty-four
years old, was now married to his first cousin
the Princess Margherita, daughter of the Duke of
Genoa, and the marriage proved immensely popular,
for the Princess possessed unusual charm, and
as soon as she was known, was beloved by the
people. The King&rsquo;s second son, Amadeus, soon
to be offered the crown of Spain, had already married
the daughter of the Prince della Cisterna, the
head of an old and devotedly loyal Piedmont family.
In the year 1869 Victor Emmanuel, who had
been seized with a severe fever in his villa near
Pisa, married the Countess Mirafiore, according
to the rites of the Church.</p>

<p>The year 1870 saw Napoleon drawn into the
war with Prussia which was to cost him his crown.
The French troops could no longer remain abroad
to support the Pope and were withdrawn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Italy. Although Napoleon had sacrificed his
alliance with Victor Emmanuel the latter would
even now have gone to his aid, but his ministers
would not permit him to take such a step. The
rapid disasters that befell French arms and the
surrender of the Emperor at Sedan caused the
Romans to make another appeal to Victor Emmanuel
to come to their aid before they should be
altogether abandoned. The time was now ripe
when the appeal could be answered. A message
containing the King&rsquo;s resolution was sent to the
provisional government at Paris, which replied
that it had no power now to oppose Italy. Yet,
even now, before sending his troops to Rome, the
King tried again to effect some pacific adjustment
with the Pope, and it was only when the latter
showed again his unaltered determination to insist
on the temporal power of the Church that the
Italian army crossed the Papal frontier.</p>

<p>September 20, 1870, is the date on which the
temporal power of the Roman Church, after many
centuries of vicissitudes, came to an end. The
Pope, although eighty years old, determined on
final resistance, and the invading army was met
at the Leonine Gate with fire from the city bastions.
The fight did not last long, the foreign
ambassadors in Rome entreated the Pope to
capitulate, but he would not do so until he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
that the royal army was actually within the city.
Then a white flag was raised on Saint Peter&rsquo;s, and
an hour later the last Papal Zouaves were surrendering
their arms. All Rome rushed to the Capitol
and burst into ecstatic acclaim as the Italian
tri-color was flung out to the breezes from the
palace. The fortress of Saint Angelo was opened
and scores of political prisoners released. Meanwhile
the Pope and the Cardinals withdrew into
the Vatican, and proclaimed to the world that they
were kept there as prisoners against their will. A
popular vote of the Romans was taken and resulted
overwhelmingly in favor of union with the
Kingdom.</p>

<p>The long struggle which had begun for Victor
Emmanuel on that far-off day of Novara, was
ended. To Piedmont had been added Lombardy,
Tuscany, Emilia, the Papal States, Sicily, Naples,
Venetia, and now Rome. The vow of the King
was accomplished, Italy was complete. The last
Parliament in Florence met December 5, 1870, and
the King in opening it said, &ldquo;With Rome the capital
of Italy I have fulfilled my promise, and
crowned the undertaking which twenty-three
years ago was initiated by my great father. As
a king and as a son, I feel in my heart a solemn
joy in saluting here assembled the representatives
of our beloved country, and in pronouncing these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
words&mdash;Italy is free and one. Now it depends on
us to make her free and happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florence had rejoiced at being the capital of
Italy, but now she surrendered that proud position
to Rome, which all Italians felt must be the
capital of the new nation. The King had no wish
to offend the Pope, indeed he and his ministers
were untiring in their efforts to effect a reconciliation
with the head of the Church, and the public
entry into Rome was delayed for almost nine
months. Meanwhile the King had entered the city
privately at a time when the Tiber had flooded its
banks and caused much distress, and had done all
that he could to relieve the needs of the poor and
homeless. On June 2, 1871, Victor Emmanuel
made his formal entry into his new capital, and
took possession of the Quirinal. On November 27
of that same year the first Parliament representing
united Italy met.</p>

<p>A little earlier Spain, rid of Isabella, and in the
hands of a provisional government, sought a king
from Italy, and found one in Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s
son, Amadeus, who went to Madrid, and reigned
there for a few troubled years, until another revolution
released him from a position which he had
never sought or desired.</p>

<p>For seven years Victor Emmanuel reigned in
Rome, and they were years of great strides in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
progress and in national unity. He visited foreign
sovereigns, and they in turn visited him; in
1873 he went to Vienna as the guest of the Austrian
Emperor Francis Joseph, and in 1876 the
latter visited him at Venice. The King of Italy,
always open-hearted and simple by nature, was
glad to forget the days when Austria had ruled
in Italy, and to form ties of friendship between
the Houses of Savoy and of Hapsburg, ties which
Francis Joseph was equally glad to make.</p>

<p>The Pope continued publicly to resent the presence
of the King in Rome, but privately he stated
his admiration for him. Pius IX. was two men in
one, delightful as a private character, but narrow
and bigoted in his public views. He still held to
his claim to temporal power over the States of
the Church, but gradually the claim ceased to be
other than an echo of history.</p>

<p>In those seven years between 1871 and 1878
the King knit his people together, met Garibaldi,
now the arch republican, and brought him to terms
of reason, concerned himself with scores of plans
for bettering the material welfare of his people,
draining the Campagna, tunneling Mont Cenis
and the St. Gothard, and building up commerce
with the East. He was always the idol of his
people, the R√® Galantuomo, in whatever part of
the country he visited. On January 9, 1878, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
died, being fifty-eight years of age, and having
reigned twenty-nine years.</p>

<p>Thousands of stories are told of Victor Emmanuel&rsquo;s
frankness and independence, of his love
of mixing with his people, and doing little acts of
kindness and charity. He was a great hunter,
never happier than when in the Alps, free as the
meanest goatherd, and forgetful of all his cares.
He had a most magnetic personality, a certain
ruggedness of character that led men to trust
him implicitly and follow him without debate. He
was the very man for his time, a leader who could
accomplish what Charles Albert could never have
done, because he was first and foremost a fighter
and never the scholastic theorist. Grouped about
him were men of the greatest ability and devotion,
such patriots as D&rsquo;Azeglio, Cavour, La Marmora,
who could do for him what they could never have
done for his father, because Victor Emmanuel
knew when to give others a free rein, and having
once given them that rein, did not immediately
jerk them back. He understood the delicate position
of a constitutional sovereign almost by instinct,
time and again he might have forced his
wish upon his country, but he understood that it
was Parliament and not he that should be supreme.
Yet, on the other hand, he did not shirk responsibility,
he was ready to assume any burden which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
would aid in delivering Italy from foreign domination.</p>

<p>Events in the lives of nations, such as the union
of the disordered states of Italy, are greater than
any man, but often such events seem to await the
coming of a certain man who shall collect within
himself the spirit of his time, and personify its
impulse in his nature. Reading this history, one
feels as though the men of the Peninsula had waited
the coming of a King of Piedmont who should
throw everything he had into the common cause,
and, without counting any cost or pain, fight to
the goal. When such a man came, then and then
only, could the forces that were preparing reach
their full growth and opportunity, then and then
only could Mazzini, Garibaldi, and Cavour put
into operation the energies for which they severally
stood.</p>

<p>In Italy to-day the memory of Victor Emmanuel
meets one on every hand, it was his fortunate fate
to rise to every opportunity, and to grow in his
people&rsquo;s affection with each step he took.</p>

<p class="ad-title">THE GADFLY</p>

<p class="ad-author">By E. L. VOYNICH. 12mo. $1.25</p>

<p class="ad-block">An intense romance of the Italian rising against
the Austrians early in the nineteenth century.
It has gone through over twenty impressions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shows us the veritable conspirator of history, who
plotted like a human being, and not like an operatic bandit,
... it is a thrilling book and absolutely sober.... &lsquo;The
Gadfly&rsquo; is an original and impressive being; ... a story to
remember. It is nothing more or less than one of the most
powerful novels of the decade.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the most interesting phases of the history of
nineteenth-century Europe. The story of the Italian revolutionary
movement ... is full of such incidents as the
novelist most desires.... This novel is one of the
strongest of the year, vivid in conception and dramatic in
execution, filled with intense human feeling, and worked
up to a tremendously impressive climax.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Dial.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Paradox worked up with intense dramatic effect is the
salient feature of &lsquo;The Gadfly&rsquo;; shows a wonderfully
strong hand, and descriptive powers which are rare; ...
a very remarkable romance.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;An historical novel permeated with a deep religious
interest in which from first to last the story is dominant
and absorbing.... &lsquo;The Gadfly&rsquo; is a figure to live in
the imagination.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Critic.</i></p>
